It is a repository of the mechanical elements of the Daggerheart system, edited and organized for clarity, conciseness, and quick reference.\nYou can use this SRD in several ways:\nï¿½ To quickly look up Daggerheartï¿½s rules-as-written during gameplay sessions.\nï¿½ To ensure any homebrew content you create or publish conforms with Daggerheartï¿½s core ruleset.\nï¿½ To provide copy text made available by Darrington Press for your own publications under their Community Gaming License (www.darringtonpress.com/license).\nï¿½ To better understand the mechanics of Daggerheart, absent the flavor and setting information, so you can bend or break them in the process of making your own content. The Daggerheart SRD is not a replacement for the core rulebook, which contains setting information, additional examples of various gameplay elements, and tons of great advice for playing Daggerheartï¿½not to mention gorgeous artwork and layout.\nIn short, it is Daggerheart, the system, boiled down to the bonesï¿½a lean and clean offering without all the flavor, style, and supporting material that makes the core rulebook such an evocative and enjoyable read. We hope this document proves useful to your table. Happy adventuring!\nTHE BASICS",

    "text": "WHAT IS DAGGERHEART?\nDaggerheart is a tabletop roleplaying game for one Game \nMaster (ï¿½GMï¿½) and 2-5 players. Each game session lasts about 2-4 hours, and Daggerheart can be played as a one-shot or a multi-session campaign of any length. \nDuring a session of Daggerheart the GM describes situations, narrates events, and controls any adversaries or obstacles that the Player Characters (ï¿½PCsï¿½) encounter. The players, in turn, roleplay their PCsï¿½ reactions to the scenario presented by the GM. If the outcome of a playerï¿½s action depends on fate or fortune, the GM calls for an action roll.\nWhen a player makes an action roll, they utilize Duality Diceï¿½two differently colored 12-sided dice (ï¿½d12sï¿½) representing Hope and Fear. The Duality Dice are rolled, relevant modifiers are added to the results, and the total is compared to a Difficulty set by the GM. If the total meets or beats the Difficulty, the player succeeds. If itï¿½s lower, they fail. In addition, the situation changes based on which Duality Die rolls higher, either giving the player helpful Hope tokens or generating terrifying Fear tokens for the GM.",

This SRD offers answers for many questions your table may have about the game, but it wonï¿½t answer all of them. When youï¿½re in doubt about how a rule applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with the narrative.\nFor example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that lets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an entire castle, the weapon text doesnï¿½t forbid you from doing thatï¿½but it doesnï¿½t make sense within the narrative. Instead, the GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull yourself toward the wall instead.\nSimilarly, if your character does something that would logically result in immediate deathï¿½such as diving into an active volcano without protectionï¿½you might not get to make one of Daggerheartï¿½s death moves, which normally give you control of your characterï¿½s fate in their final moments. This kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world. \nAs a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are encouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and the GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction.",

Some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects, new downtime or social encounter abilities, or one-time benefits.\n\tDOMAIN CARD ANATOMY\nEach domain card includes six elements:\nLevel\nThe number in the top left of the card indicates the cardï¿½s level. You cannot acquire a domain card with a level higher than your PCï¿½s.\nDomain\nBeneath the cardï¿½s level there is a symbol indicating its domain. You can only choose cards from your classï¿½s two domains. \nRecall Cost\nThe number and lightning bolt in the top right of the card shows its Recall Cost. This is the amount of Stress a player must mark to swap this card from their vault with a card from their loadout.\nNote: A player can swap domain cards during downtime without paying the domain cardï¿½s Recall Cost.  \nTitle\nThe name of the card.\nType\nThe cardï¿½s type is listed in the center above the title. There are three types of domain cards: abilities, spells, and grimoires. Abilities are typically non-magical in nature, while spells are magical. Grimoires are unique to the Codex domain and grant access to a collection of less potent spells. Some game mechanics only apply to certain types of cards.\nFeature\nThe text on the bottom half of the card describes its feature(s), including any special rules you need to follow when you use that card.\n\tLOADOUT & VAULT\nYour loadout is the set of acquired domain cards whose effects your PC can use during play. You can have up to 5 domain cards in your loadout at one time. Once youï¿½ve acquired six or more domain cards, you must choose five to keep in your loadout; the rest are considered to be in your vault. Vault cards are inactive and do not influence play\nNote: Your subclass, ancestry, and community cards donï¿½t count toward your loadout or vault and are always active and available.\nAt the start of a rest, before using downtime moves, you can freely move cards between your loadout and your vault, so long as your loadout doesnï¿½t exceed its five-card maximum.\nTo move a card from your vault to your loadout at any other time, you must mark a number of Stress equal to the vaulted cardï¿½s Recall Cost (located in the top right of the card next to the lightning bolt symbol). If your loadout is already full, you must also move a card from your loadout to your vault to make space, though you can do this at no cost.\nWhen you gain a new domain card at level-up, you can immediately move it into your loadout for free. If your loadout is already full, you must also move a card from your loadout to your vault to make space.\n\tUSAGE LIMITS\nIf a domain card restricts how often it can be used, you can track such limits with whatever method you prefer, such as turning the card sideways, flipping it facedown, or using tokens. \nNote: if an effect or ability gives you a number of uses equal to a trait with a modifier of +0 or less, it grants you 0 uses.",

While one might underestimate a gentle druid who practices the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who channel the untamed forces of nature are terrifying to behold. Druids cultivate their abilities in small groups, often connected by a specific ethos or locale, but some choose to work alone. Through years of study and dedication, druids can learn to transform into beasts and shape nature itself.\n\nDOMAINS - Sage & Arcana\nSTARTING EVASION - 10 STARTING HIT POINTS - 6\nCLASS ITEMS - A small bag of rocks and bones or a strange pendant found in the dirt\nDRUIDï¿½S HOPE FEATURE\nEvolution: Spend 3 Hope to transform into a Beastform without marking a Stress. When you do, choose one trait to raise by +1 until you drop out of that Beastform.\n\tCLASS FEATURES\nBeastform: Mark a Stress to magically transform into a creature of your tier or lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any time. While transformed, you canï¿½t use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you have access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay active and last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastformï¿½s features, add their Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for your attack. While youï¿½re in a Beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out of this form.\nWildtouch: You can perform harmless, subtle effects that involve natureï¿½such as causing a flower to rapidly grow, summoning a slight gust of wind, or starting a campfireï¿½ at will.\nDRUID SUBCLASSES\nChoose either the Warden of the Elements or Warden of Renewal subclass.",

At the GMï¿½s discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category.\nBeastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details:\nï¿½ Creature Category: Each categoryï¿½s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).\nï¿½ Character Trait: While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.\nï¿½ Attack Rolls: When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creatureï¿½s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.\nï¿½ Evasion: While transformed, you add the creatureï¿½s \nEvasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says ï¿½Evasion +2,ï¿½ your Evasion becomes 10 while youï¿½re in that form.\nï¿½ Advantages: Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.\nï¿½ Features: Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dexterous movementï¿½but theyï¿½re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform.",

While many guardians join groups of militants for either a country or cause, theyï¿½re more likely to follow those few they truly care for, majority be damned. Guardians are known for fighting with remarkable ferocity even against overwhelming odds, defending their cohort above all else. Woe betide those who harm the ally of a guardian, as the guardian will answer this injury in kind. \n\nDOMAINS - Valor and Blade\nSTARTING EVASION - 9 STARTING HIT POINTS - 7\nCLASS ITEMS - A totem from your mentor or a secret key\nGUARDIANï¿½S HOPE FEATURE\nFrontline Tank: Spend 3 Hope to clear 2 Armor Slots.\n\tCLASS FEATURE\nUnstoppable: Once per long rest, you can become \nUnstoppable. You gain an Unstoppable Die. At level 1, your Unstoppable Die is a d4. Place it on your character sheet in the space provided, starting with the 1 value facing up. After you make a damage roll that deals 1 or more Hit Points to a target, increase the Unstoppable Die value by one. When the dieï¿½s value would exceed its maximum value or when the scene ends, remove the die and drop out of Unstoppable. At level 5, your Unstoppable Die increases to a d6.\nWhile Unstoppable, you gain the following benefits:\nï¿½ You reduce the severity of physical damage by one threshold (Severe to Major, Major to Minor, Minor to None).\nï¿½ You add the current value of the Unstoppable Die to your damage roll.\nï¿½ You canï¿½t be Restrained or Vulnerable.\nTip: If your Unstoppable Die is a d4 and the 4 is currently facing up, you remove the die the next time you would increase it. However, if your Unstoppable Die has increased to a d6 and the 4 is currently facing up, youï¿½ll turn it to 5 the next time you would increase it. In this case, youï¿½ll remove the die after you would need to increase it higher than 6.\nGUARDIAN SUBCLASSES\nChoose either the Stalwart or Vengeance subclass.",

Some seraphs ally themselves with an army or locale, much to the satisfaction of their rulers, but other crusaders fight in opposition to the follies of the Mortal Realm.

The act of becoming a formidable sorcerer is not the practice of acquiring power, but learning to cultivate and control the power one already possesses.

On a success, you create a minor visual illusion no larger than yourself within Close range. This illusion is convincing to anyone at Close range or farther.\nChannel Raw Power: Once per long rest, you can place a domain card from your loadout into your vault and choose to either:\nï¿½ Gain Hope equal to the level of the card.\nï¿½ Enhance a spell that deals damage, gaining a bonus to your damage roll equal to twice the level of the card.\nSORCERER SUBCLASSES\nChoose either the Elemental Origin or Primal Origin subclass.",

When you make an attack roll or damage roll, you can spend any number of these Slayer Dice, rolling them and adding their result to the roll. At the end of each session, clear any unspent Slayer Dice on this card and gain a Hope per die cleared.\n\tSPECIALIZATION FEATURE\nWeapon Specialist: You can wield multiple weapons with dangerous ease. When you succeed on an attack, you can spend a Hope to add one of the damage dice from your secondary weapon to the damage roll. Additionally, once per long rest when you roll your Slayer Dice, reroll any 1s.\nMASTERY FEATURE\nMartial Preparation: Youï¿½re an inspirational warrior to all who travel with you. Your party gains access to the Martial Preparation downtime move. To use this move during a rest, describe how you instruct and train with your party. You and each ally who chooses this downtime move gain a d6 Slayer Die. A PC with a Slayer Die can spend it to roll the die and add the result to an attack or damage roll of their choice.",

Many wizards become wise and powerful figures in their communities, advising rulers, providing medicines and healing, and even leading war councils.

Like organic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes. Because of their bespoke construction, many clanks have highly specialized physical configurations. Examples include clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry. \nMany clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as function, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank artisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using their own physical characteristics as inspiration, but itï¿½s also common for clanks to build one another. A clankï¿½s lifespan extends as long as theyï¿½re able to acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate as the magic that powers them loses potency.\nANCESTRY FEATURES\nPurposeful Design: Decide who made you and for what purpose.

These characteristics can include celestial freckles, the presence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their hair, eyes that flicker like fire, and more. Sometimes these traits are inherited from parents, but if an elf changes their environment or magical focus, their appearance changes over time. Because elves live for about 350 years, these traits can shift more than once throughout their lifespan.\n\tANCESTRY FEATURES\nQuick Reactions: Mark a Stress to gain advantage on a reaction roll.\nCelestial Trance: During a rest, you can drop into a trance to choose an additional downtime move.",

Some have faces that are a blend of humanoid and bison, ox, cow, or other bovine creatures. Others, often referred to as minotaurs, have heads that entirely resemble cattle. They are tall and muscular creatures, with heights ranging from around 5 feet to\n7 feet, and possess remarkable strength no matter their age. Some firbolgs are known to use this strength to charge their adversaries, an action that is particuarly effective for those who have one of the many varieties of horn styles commonly found in this ancestry. Though their unique characteristics can vary, all firbolgs are covered in fur, which can be muted and earth-toned in color, or come in a variety of pastels, such as soft pinks and blues. On average, firbolgs live for about 150 years.  \n\tANCESTRY FEATURES\nCharge: When you succeed on an Agility Roll to move from Far or Very Far range into Melee range with one or more targets, you can mark a Stress to deal 1d12 physical damage to all targets within Melee range.\nUnshakable: When you would mark a Stress, roll a d6.

These horns can also grow asymmetrically, forming unique, often curving, shapes that infernis enhance with carving and ornamentation. Their skin, hair, and horns come in an assortment of colors that can include soft pastels, stark tones, or vibrant hues, such as rosy scarlet, deep purple, and pitch black. \nInfernis possess a ï¿½dread visageï¿½ that manifests both involuntarily, such as when they experience fear or other strong emotions, or purposefully, such as when they wish to intimidate an adversary. This visage can briefly modify their appearance in a variety of ways, including lengthening their teeth and nails, changing the colors of their eyes, twisting their horns, or enhancing their height. On average, infernis live up to 350 years, with some attributing this lifespan to their demonic lineage.\n\tANCESTRY FEATURES\nFearless: When you roll with Fear, you can mark 2 Stress to change it into a roll with Hope instead.\nDread Visage: You have advantage on rolls to intimidate hostile creatures.",

Determine Ancestry Combination  When you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down how your character identifies themself in the Heritage section of your character sheet. For example, if your character is descended from both goblins and orcs, you could use a hybridized term, such as ï¿½goblin-orc,ï¿½ to describe your ancestry, list only the ancestry you more closely identify with (e.g., just ï¿½goblinï¿½ or just ï¿½orcï¿½), or invent a new term, such as ï¿½toothling.ï¿½\n2. Choose Ancestry Features  \nWork with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries in your characterï¿½s lineage. You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet. \nFor example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the ï¿½Surefootedï¿½ and ï¿½Tusksï¿½ features or the ï¿½Sturdyï¿½ and ï¿½Danger Senseï¿½ features. You canï¿½t take both the ï¿½Surefootedï¿½ and ï¿½Sturdyï¿½ features, because these are both the first features listed on their respective ancestry cards.\nYour character's heritage might include more than two ancestries, but you still only choose features from two.

It is a hallmark of wildborne societies to integrate their villages and cities with the natural environment and avoid disturbing the lives of the plants and animals. While some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, others establish their homes on the ground beneath the forest canopy.

The GM responds to these questions by giving the players information their characters could easily obtain, or by asking questions of their own to the players. The players also respond to any questions the GM poses to them. In this way, the table builds out the fiction collaboratively.\nSTEP 3 BUILD ON THE FICTION\nAs the scene develops, the players find opportunities to take actionï¿½problems to solve, obstacles to overcome, mysteries to investigate, and so on. The players describe how their characters proceed; if their proposed actions carry no chance of failure (or if failure would be boring), they automatically succeed. But if the outcome of their action is unknown, the GM calls for an action roll. Either way, the table works the outcome into the story and moves the fiction forward, narrating how the PCï¿½s actions have changed things.\nSTEP 4\nGO BACK TO STEP 1\nThe process repeats from the beginning, with the GM relaying any updated details or material changes to the players. This process continues until the end of the scene is triggered by a mechanic or arrives organically.",

If more than one trait could apply to the roll, the GM chooses or lets the acting player decide. \n\tSTEP 2: DETERMINE THE DIFFICULTY\nSome actions and features say in their description what the Difficulty is. Otherwise, the GM determines the Difficulty based on the scenario. The GM can choose whether to share the Difficulty with the table. In either case, the GM should communicate the potential consequences of failure to the acting player.\n\tSTEP 3: APPLY EXTRA DICE AND MODIFIERS\nThe acting player decides whether to Utilize an Experience or activate other effects, then, if applicable, adds the appropriate tokens and dice (such as advantage or Rally dice) to their dice pool. \nNote: Unless an action, ability, or feature specifically allows for it, a player must declare the use of any Experiences, extra dice, or other modifiers before they roll.\n\tSTEP 4: ROLL THE DICE\nThe acting player rolls their entire dice pool and announces the results in the format of ï¿½[total result] with [Hope/Fear]ï¿½ï¿½ or ï¿½Critical Success!ï¿½ in the case of matching Duality Dice. \nExample: A player is making an action roll with a +1 in the relevant trait and no other modifiers; they roll the Duality Dice and get a result of 5 on their Hope Die and 7 on their Fear Die, then announce ï¿½I rolled a 13 with Fear!ï¿½\nSTEP 5: RESOLVE THE OUTCOME\nThe active player and the GM work together, along with the suggestions and support of the rest of the table, to resolve the outcome of the action.",

While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Very Close range into Melee range. On a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card (2-3 inches).\nClose: Close enough to see prominent details, about 10ï¿½30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from Close range into Melee range. On a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5-6 inches).\nFar: Close enough to see very little detail, about 30ï¿½100 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Far range into Melee range. On a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a piece of copy paper (11ï¿½12 inches).\nVery Far: Too far to make out any details, about 100ï¿½300 feet away. While in danger, a character must make an Agility Roll to safely move from Very Far range into Melee range. On a map: anything beyond Far range, but still within the bounds of the conflict or scene.\nOut of Range: Anything beyond a characterï¿½s Very Far range is Out of Range and usually canï¿½t be targeted.\nRange is measured from the source of an effect, such as the attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect.\nA weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effectï¿½s stated range is a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at closer distances.\nOptional Rule: Defined Ranges\nIf your table would rather operate with more precise range rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat.

During a rest, each PC can make up to two downtime moves.\nWhen the party rests, they must choose between a short rest and a long rest. If a party takes three short rests in a row, their next rest must be a long rest.\nIf a short rest is interrupted, such as by an adversary's attack, the characters donï¿½t gain its benefits. If a long rest is interrupted, the characters only gain the benefits of a short rest. \nA short rest lasts enough time for the party to catch its breath, about an hour in-world. Each player can move domain cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can choose the same move twice):\nï¿½ Tend to Wounds: Clear 1d4+Tier Hit Points for yourself or an ally.\nï¿½ Clear Stress: Clear 1d4+Tier Stress.\nï¿½ Repair Armor: Clear 1d4+Tier Armor Slots from your or an allyï¿½s armor.\nï¿½ Prepare: Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope. At the end of a short rest, any features or effects with a limited number of uses per rest refresh and any features or effects that last until your next rest expire. \nA long rest is when the characters make camp and relax or sleep for several in-game hours. Each player can move domain cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can choose the same move twice):\nï¿½ Tend to All Wounds: Clear all Hit Points for yourself or an ally.\nï¿½ Clear All Stress: Clear all Stress.\nï¿½ Repair All Armor: Clear all Armor Slots from your or an allyï¿½s armor \nï¿½ Prepare: Describe how you prepare for the next dayï¿½s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.\nï¿½ Work on a Project: With GM approval, a PC may pursue a long-term project, such as deciphering an ancient text or crafting a new weapon. The first time they start a new project, assign it a countdown. Each time a PC makes the Work on a Project move, they either advance their projectï¿½s countdown automatically or make an action roll to advance it (GMï¿½s choice).\nAt the end of a long rest, any features or effects with a limited number of uses per rest or per long rest refresh and any features or effects that last until your next rest or until your next long rest expire. \n\tDOWNTIME CONSEQUENCES\nOn a short rest, the GM gains 1d4 Fear. On a long rest, they gain Fear equal to 1d4 + the number of PCs, and they can advance a long-term countdown of their choice.",

Take one final action. It automatically critically succeeds (with GM approval), and then you cross through the veil of death.\nï¿½ Avoid Death: Your character avoids death and faces the consequences. They temporarily drop unconscious, and then you work with the GM to describe how the situation worsens. While unconscious, your character canï¿½t move or act, and they canï¿½t be targeted by an attack. They return to consciousness when an ally clears 1 or more of their marked Hit Points or when the party finishes a long rest. After your character falls unconscious, roll your Hope Die. If its value is equal to or less than your characterï¿½s level, they gain a scar: permanently cross out a Hope slot and work with the GM to determine its lasting narrative impact and how, if possible, it can be restored. If you ever cross out your last Hope slot, your characterï¿½s journey ends.\nï¿½ Risk It All: Roll your Duality Dice. If the Hope Die is higher, your character stays on their feet and clears a number of Hit Points or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die (you can divide the Hope Die value between Hit Points and Stress however youï¿½d prefer). If the Fear Die is higher, your character crosses through the veil of death. If the Duality Dice show matching results, your character stays up and clears all Hit Points and Stress.\nIf your character dies, work with the GM before the next session to create a new character at the current level of the rest of the party.",

If the damage includes a flat modifier, this number is added to the total damage rolled, but is not altered or affected by Proficiency.\n\tDAMAGE TYPE\nA weaponï¿½s damage type indicates whether it deals physical or magic damage. Weapons that deal magic damage can only be wielded by characters with a Spellcast trait.\n\tBURDEN\nA weaponï¿½s burden indicates how many hands it occupies when equipped. Your characterï¿½s maximum burden is 2 hands.\n\tFEATURE\nA weaponï¿½s feature is a special rule that stays in effect while the weapon is equipped.\nYou can throw an equipped weapon at a target within Very Close range, making the attack roll with Finesse. On a success, deal damage as usual for that weapon. Once thrown, the weapon is no longer considered equipped.

    "text": "Combat Wheelchair\nBy Mark Thompson\nThe combat wheelchair is a ruleset designed to help you play a wheelchair user in Daggerheart. This section provides mechanics and narrative guidance for you to work from, but feel free to adapt the flavor text to best suit your character. Have fun with your characterï¿½s wheelchair design, and make it as unique or tailored to them as you please.\n\nACTION AND MOVEMENT\nWhen describing how your character moves, you can use descriptions such as the following:\nï¿½ ï¿½I roll over to the door to see if itï¿½s open.ï¿½\nï¿½ ï¿½I wheel myself over to the group to ask whatï¿½s going on.ï¿½\nï¿½ ï¿½I pull my brakes and skid to a halt, turning in my seat to level my bow at the intruder.ï¿½\nCONSEQUENCES\nHere are some ways you might describe complications you encounter when your character uses their wheelchair:\nï¿½I pull my brakes, but I donï¿½t think to account for the loose gravel on the ground.ï¿½\nï¿½I hit a patch of ice awkwardly and am sent skidding out past my target.ï¿½\nï¿½I go to push off in pursuit, but one of my front caster \nwheels snags on a crack in the pavement, stalling me for a moment.ï¿½\nGMs should avoid breaking a character's wheelchair or otherwise removing it from play as a consequence, unless everyone at the table, especially the wheelchair userï¿½s player, gives their approval.\nLight Frame Models\nEVASION\nYour character is assumed to be skilled in moving their wheelchair and navigating numerous situations in it. As a result, the only wheelchair that gives a penalty to a PC's Evasion is the Heavy Frame model.\nBURDEN\nAll wheelchairs can be maneuvered using one or two hands outside of combat. However, when being used as a weapon, the chair is restricted to requiring one or two hands to perform attacks, depending on the model youï¿½ve chosen. If youï¿½re playing a character who has limited to no mobility in their arms, their wheelchair can be attuned to them by magical means. For example, your character might use a psychic link to guide the chair around like a pseudo-electric wheelchair. All the rules presented here can be tailored and adapted to any character's needs.\nCHOOSING YOUR MODEL\nAll combat wheelchairs are equipped as Primary Weapons. There are three models of wheelchair available: light, heavy, and arcane. Youï¿½re encouraged to consider the type of character youï¿½re playing and the class they belong to, then choose the model that best matches that character concept.\n\nThough tough, these wheelchairs have light frames that allow the chair to move with your character in more acrobatic ways.  These models are best suited to adventurers who rely on speed and flexibility.\nName\tTier\tTrait\tRange\tDamage\tBurden\tFeature\nLight-Frame Wheelchair\n1\nAgility\nMelee\nd8 phy\nOne-Handed\nQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.\nImproved \nLight-Frame \nWheelchair\n2\nAgility\nMelee\nd8+3 phy\nOne-Handed\nQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.\nAdvanced \nLight-Frame \nWheelchair\n3\nAgility\nMelee\nd8+6 phy\nOne-Handed\nQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.\nLegendary \nLight-Frame \nWheelchair\n4\nAgility\nMelee\nd8+9 phy\nOne-Handed\nQuick: When you make an attack, you can mark a Stress to target another creature within range.\nHeavy Frame Models\nThese wheelchairs have bulky and heavier frames, allowing the chair to lend its weight to your characterï¿½s attacks. It also makes them a bigger target.\nName\nTier\nTrait\nRange\nDamage\nBurden\nFeature\nHeavy-Frame Wheelchair\n1\nStrength\nMelee\nd12+3 phy\nTwo-Handed\nHeavy: ?1 to Evasion\nImproved \nHeavy-Frame \nWheelchair\n2\nStrength\nMelee\nd12+6 phy\nTwo-Handed\nHeavy: ?1 to Evasion\nAdvanced \nHeavy-Frame \nWheelchair\n3\nStrength\nMelee\nd12+9 phy\nTwo-Handed\nHeavy: ?1 to Evasion\nLegendary \nHeavy-Frame \nWheelchair\n4\nStrength\nMelee\nd12+12 phy\nTwo-Handed\nHeavy: ?1 to Evasion\nArcane Frame Models\nThese wheelchairs have frames that are attuned to your character and their magic, allowing them to channel their spells through the chair. Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesnï¿½t specify a trait to use when making an attack with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.\nName\nTier\nTrait\nRange\nDamage\nBurden\nFeature\nArcane-Frame Wheelchair\n1\nSpellcast\nFar\nd6 mag\nOne-Handed\nReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nImproved \nArcane-Frame \nWheelchair\n2\nSpellcast\nFar\nd6+3 mag\nOne-Handed\nReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nAdvanced \nArcane-Frame \nWheelchair\n3\nSpellcast\nFar\nd6+6 mag\nOne-Handed\nReliable: +1 to attack rolls\nLegendary \nArcane-Frame \nWheelchair\n4\nSpellcast\nFar\nd6+9 mag\nOne-Handed\nReliable: +1 to attack rolls",

Some armor also has a feature.\nï¿½ An armorï¿½s base armor score indicates how many Armor Slots it provides its wearer before additional bonuses are added to calculate their total Armor Score. A PCï¿½s Armor Score canï¿½t exceed 12.\nï¿½ An armorï¿½s base thresholds determine its wearerï¿½s major and severe damage thresholds before adding bonuses to calculate their final damage thresholds.\nï¿½ An armorï¿½s feature is a special rule that stays in effect while the armor is equipped.\nWhile unarmored, your characterï¿½s base Armor Score is 0, their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe threshold is equal to twice their level.\n\t\tREDUCING INCOMING DAMAGE\nWhen you take damage, you can mark one Armor Slot to reduce the number of Hit Points you would mark by one. If your character has an Armor Score of 0, you canï¿½t mark Armor Slots. If an effect temporarily increases your Armor Score, it increases your available Armor Slots by the same amount; when the effect ends, so does the availability of these Armor Slots.\nARMOR TABLES\nTIER 1 (LEVEL 1)\nName\n     Base Thresholds\nBase \nScore\nFeature\nGambeson Armor\n5 / 11\n3\nFlexible: +1 to Evasion\nLeather Armor\n6 / 13\n3\nï¿½\nChainmail Armor\n7 / 15\n4\nHeavy: ?1 to Evasion\nFull Plate Armor\n8 / 17\n4\nVery Heavy: ?2 to Evasion; ?1 to Agility\nTIER 2 (LEVELS \nName\n2ï¿½4)\nBase \nThresholds\nBase Score\nFeature\nImproved Gambeson Armor\n7 / 16\n4\nFlexible: +1 to Evasion\nImproved Leather Armor\n9 / 20\n4\nï¿½\nImproved Chainmail Armor\n11 / 24\n5\nHeavy: ?1 to Evasion\nImproved Full Plate Armor\n13 / 28\n5\nVery Heavy: ?2 to Evasion; ?1 to Agility\nElundrian Chain Armor\n9 / 21\n4\nWarded: You reduce incoming magic damage by your Armor Score before applying it to your damage thresholds.\nHarrowbone Armor\n9 / 21\n4\nResilient: Before you mark your last Armor Slot, roll a d6.

When you have marked all of the slots in a category and you gain another gold reward in that category, mark a slot in the following category and clear all the slots in the current one. \nFor example, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you instead mark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags and gain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags. \nYou canï¿½t have more than 1 chest, so if all your Gold slots are marked, youï¿½ll need to spend some of your gold or store it somewhere else before you can acquire more.\nOptional Rule: Gold Coins\nIf your group wants to track gold with more granularity, you can add coins as your lowest denomination. Following the established pattern, 10 coins equal 1 handful.\n\nRUNNING AN ADVENTURE",

If the total meets or beats the targetï¿½s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, the attack fails. On a successful attack, roll the attackï¿½s damage dice to determine how much it deals.\nIf you roll a natural 20 on an attack, your roll automatically succeeds and you deal extra damage. Roll damage normally, then add the highest number on the damage dice to the total. For example, an attack that deals 3d6+2 deals 18+3d6+2 on a critical success; the critical success does not affect the flat damage modifier. \nNote: a critical success on an adversaryï¿½s reaction roll automatically succeeds, but confers no additional benefit.\n\tGUIDANCE ON ACTION ROLLS\nAfter a player describes a move they want to make during the game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to determine how the scene progresses. Use this guide to determine what to present the player, choosing whichever option best fits the situation:\nï¿½ Determine whether the roll is necessary, considering the PCï¿½s Experiences or backstory, the pressure theyï¿½re acting under, and the possible outcomes. \nï¿½ Establish the stakes of an action roll before the player makes it. \nï¿½ Communicate any unavoidable consequences.\nï¿½ If desired, you can offer the player the opportunity to forgo an action roll in exchange for agreeing to an interesting outcome, cost, or complication.",

    "text": "MAKING MOVES\nAs the GM, you have GM moves that change the story in response to the playersï¿½ actions. GM moves arenï¿½t bound by specific spells or effectsï¿½when you make a GM move, you can describe the action in whatever way the fiction demands.\nGM moves happen during GM turns. A GM turn begins when the spotlight passes to them and ends when the spotlight passes back to the players.\n\tWHEN TO MAKE A MOVE\nThe GM can make a GM move whenever you want, but the frequency and severity depends on the type of story youï¿½re telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the session youï¿½re running. Make a GM move when the players:\nï¿½ Roll with Fear\nï¿½ Fail an action roll\nï¿½ Do something that has unavoidable consequences\nï¿½ Give you a ï¿½golden opportunityï¿½ (an opening that demands an immediate response)\nï¿½ Look to you for what happens next\n\tCHOOSING GM MOVES\nThe result of a playerï¿½s action roll determines your response:\nOn a Critical Success, you let the player describe their success, then give them an additional opportunity or advantage.\nOn a Success with Hope, you let the player describe their success, then you show how the world reacts to it.\nOn a Success with Fear, you work with the player to describe their success, then take a Fear and make a GM move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost:\nï¿½ An adversary attacks\nï¿½ The PC marks a Stress\nï¿½ You introduce a new threat\nï¿½ You raise the stakes of the conflict\nOn a Failure with Hope, you describe how the PC fails to get what they want, then make a GM move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost:\nï¿½ An adversary attacks\nï¿½ The PC marks a Stress\nï¿½ You introduce a new threat\nï¿½ You raise the stakes of the conflict\nOn a Failure with Fear, you describe how things go wrong, then make a GM move to introduce a major consequence, complication, or cost:\nï¿½ You put them in immediate danger\nï¿½ They become the focus of multiple adversaries\nï¿½ They are separated from their party ï¿½ They lose an important opportunity for good.\n\tQUICK REFERENCE:  \nRESOLVING ACTION ROLLS\nIf youï¿½re unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick phrases:\nSuccess with Hope: Yes, andï¿½ (You get what you want and gain a Hope.)\nSuccess with Fear: Yes, butï¿½ (You get what you want, but thereï¿½s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)\nFailure with Hope: No, butï¿½ (Things donï¿½t go as planned, but you gain a Hope.)\nFailure with Fear: No, andï¿½ (Things donï¿½t go as planned and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)\nIf the move you should make is not obvious from the fiction, draw inspiration from the ï¿½Example GM Movesï¿½ list:\nï¿½ Introduce a new obstacle or enemy\nï¿½ Ask the player what happens\nï¿½ Have the PC mark a Stress\nï¿½ Tell the players ï¿½everything is fineï¿½ for now.ï¿½\n\tSOFT AND HARD MOVES\nSoft moves go easier on the playersï¿½they give the party new information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to react to it. Hard moves are harsher, more impactful, or more directï¿½the PCs donï¿½t get an opening to interrupt, alter, or anticipate the outcome.\nUse softer moves on rolls with Hope and harder moves on rolls with Fear.",

Any other action an adversary attempts simply succeeds without an action roll; if you want an adversaryï¿½s action to have a chance of failure, have any relevant PCs make reaction rolls instead. \nHowever, for especially dramatic or difficult tasks that the PCs canï¿½t influence, you can give an adversary an action roll anyway. For an adversaryï¿½s action roll, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or greater than the actionï¿½s Difficulty, the action succeedsï¿½otherwise it fails. You can spend a Fear before rolling to add a relevant Experience from the adversaryï¿½s stat block to the total. Use the same procedure when an adversary makes a reaction roll.\n\tADVERSARY ADVANTAGE & DISADVANTAGE\nIf an adversary has advantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 and counts only the higher result. If an adversary has disadvantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 and counts only the lower result.\n\tADVERSARY ATTACKS\nWhen an adversary attacks a PC, the GM rolls a d20 and adds the adversaryï¿½s Attack Modifier to the result. If the total meets or beats the targetï¿½s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Before rolling, the GM can grant the attacking adversary advantage, impose disadvantage, or spend a Fear to add a relevant Experience from the adversaryï¿½s stat block to the total.\nOn a success, the adversary deals the damage listed in their stat block to the target. \nWhen an adversaryï¿½s action lets the GM make an attack against multiple targets, they make one attack roll and compare it to each targetï¿½s Evasion separately.",

Differentiate NPCs with unique manners of speech and action; let their individual goals and desires motivate their actions.\nThe only essential elements for a NPC are their name, description, and motive. If itï¿½s likely that the PCs will roll actions against them, give them a Difficulty. Adversaries can be invented or improvised by modifying the stat block of another adversary.\nIf an NPC becomes an ally in combat, they donï¿½t need a stat blockï¿½just put the spotlight on what they do and show how their involvement alters the fiction. If a PC capitalizes on their help during the scene, give the PC advantage. NPCs that donï¿½t have Hit Points or Stress can still be injured or killed if the fiction demands it.\nIf you want an important NPC to mechanically interact with the system, you can give them one or more features with specific triggers and effects. An NPC might also have a choice that adjusts the parameters of their feature. For example:\nARCANE HOLD\nChoice: When the battle begins, choose a favored PC.\nTrigger: The first time during a battle the favored PC is within Close range and hit with an attack.\nEffect: Make an attack roll with a +6 modifier against the adversary.

The GM establishes whatï¿½s at stake and how the roll will be interpreted. Then a player rolls one of their Duality Dice and interprets the result. \nExamples:\nï¿½Roll your Fear Die. On a 4 or lower, the fire spreads beyond this house.ï¿½\nï¿½I think itï¿½s really up to chance whether reinforcements will make it to you in time. Go ahead and roll your Fear Dieï¿½ thatï¿½ll determine the starting size of the countdown. When that triggers, reinforcements will arrive in your Far range.ï¿½\nï¿½Go ahead and roll your Hope Die to see how big the crowd \nat the inn is tonight. The higher the roll, the bigger the crowd.ï¿½\nï¿½Make a roll using your Hope Die to determine the number of Stamina Potions the shop has in stock.ï¿½\n\tFALLING AND COLLISION DAMAGE\nIf a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as a guide to determine the damage they take:\nï¿½ A fall from Very Close range deals 1d10+3 physical damage.\nï¿½ A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage.\nï¿½ A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical damage, or death at the GMï¿½s discretion.\nIf a character collides with an object or another character at a dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage.\n\tMOVING AND FIGHTING UNDERWATER\nBy default, attack rolls made while the attacker is underwater have disadvantage.\nFor creatures that canï¿½t breathe underwater, use a standard countdown (3) to track how long they can hold their breath. Advance the countdown whenever the PC takes an action. In addition if they fail a roll or roll with Fear while underwater, you can spend your GM move to advance it an additional timeï¿½or twice, if they rolled a failure with Fear.\nOnce the countdown ends, the underwater PC must mark a Stress whenever they take an action.\n\tCONFLICT BETWEEN PCS\nSometimes a player might want their character to act against another PC in the scene. Before jumping to rolling dice, discuss the situation with both players to decide how to resolve the conflict. A roll might not be necessary to reach an outcomeï¿½but if rolling will be fun for everyone involved, come to a consensus on the terms of the roll, then facilitate the scene according to the results. \nOn an attack roll against a PC, the attacker rolls against the defenderï¿½s Evasion, just like an adversary. On any other kind of action roll, the instigator makes an action roll and the target makes a reaction roll. To succeed, the instigator must beat a Difficulty equal to the total value of the reaction roll. \nADVERSARIES AND ENVIRONMENTS",

The adversary types are:\nï¿½ Bruisers: tough; deliver powerful attacks.\nï¿½ Hordes: groups of identical creatures acting together as a single unit.\nï¿½ Leaders: command and summon other adversaries.\nï¿½ Minions: easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers.\nï¿½ Ranged: fragile in close encounters but deal high damage at range.\nï¿½ Skulks: maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush opponents.\nï¿½ Socials: present challenges around conversation instead of combat.\nï¿½ Solos: present a formidable challenge to a whole party, with or without support.\nï¿½ Standards: representative of their fictional group.\nï¿½ Supports: enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents.\n\tDESCRIPTION\nA summary of the adversary's appearance and demeanor.\n\tMOTIVES & TACTICS\nSuggusted impulses, actions and goals for the adversary.\n\tDIFFICULTY\nThe Difficulty of any roll made against the adversary, unless otherwise noted.\n\tDAMAGE THRESHOLDS, HIT POINTS,  \nAND STRESS\nThese systems function the same way they do for PCs. The numbers listed after ï¿½Thresholdï¿½ are the adversaryï¿½s Major and Severe Thresholds.\n\tATTACK MODIFIER\nWhen you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or penalty to your attack roll.\n\tSTANDARD ATTACK\nA description of the adversaryï¿½s primary mode of inflicting harm on the PCs. It includes the attackï¿½s name, its effective range, and the damage it deals on a success. Using an adversaryï¿½s standard attack is a GM move.\n\tEXPERIENCE (OPTIONAL)\nThe GM can spend a Fear to add an adversaryï¿½s relevant Experience to raise their attack roll or increase the Difficulty of a roll made against them.\nEXAMPLE EXPERIENCES:\nAcrobatics\nHunt from Above\nNavigation\nAmbusher\nIntimidation\nNobility\nBartering\nIntrusion\nQuick Reflexes\nBlademaster\nKeen Senses\nSocialite\nBodyguard\nMagical Knowledge\nStealth\nCommander\tNatureï¿½s Friend\tTracker \tFEATURE(S)\nThere are three kinds of adversary features: actions, reactions, and passives. Note: each adversaries stress is tracked individually. If a feature requires the GM to spend Stress to activate it, the Stress must come from the adversary whose feature is being activate. If a feature has a Fear requirement, it must be spent in addition to any Fear already spentï¿½for instance, to interrupt the PCs and put the spotlight on the adversary.\nï¿½ Actions: a special attack or other unique action that the adversary can perform when the spotlight is on them.\nï¿½ Reactions: special effects that take effect when their trigger occurs, regardless of whether the spotlight is on the adversary.\nï¿½ Passives: special abilities that remain in effect by default and require no resources or triggers to activate.\n\tFEAR FEATURE(S)\nHigh-impact effects that cost a Fear to activate.",

    "text": "ADDITIONAL GM GUIDANCE\nThis section provides additional guidance for preparing and running a session of Daggerheart. \nSTORY BEATS\nIn storytelling, a beat is a moment that changes the trajectory of the narrativeï¿½a shift in the world, a significant action or reaction, an emotional revelation, or an important decision. Take turns with the players, narrating a beat and then letting them react and carry the scene forward with their own beats. When preparing for a session, plan in terms of the moments that give shape to each scene or sequence, rather than prescripting specific details or exchanges.\nPREPARING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS\nBuild the hurdles the PCs face around the question of ï¿½What helps tell the story?ï¿½ Enemies, environments, and hazards are the tools for heightening tension and creating drama. Ensure that combat is being used to give players more information about the unfolding story, revealing the world, the plot, or the characters. \nBATTLES AND NARRATIVE\nDynamic battles create suspense by forcing players to choose between their various objectives, engaging their characterï¿½s motivations and weaknesses, and creating the crucible that the players use to forge their characters into legendary heroes. When preparing combat encounters:\nï¿½ Consider the narrative function of the battle\nï¿½ Base adversariesï¿½ moves on their motives\nï¿½ Use dynamic environments to bring the battleground to life\nï¿½ Add enemies that can interact with the PCsï¿½ features and special abilities\nSESSION REWARDS\nReward players at the end of a session with:\nï¿½ Useful information\nï¿½ Story hooks\nï¿½ Loot \nï¿½ Gold\nï¿½ Access to new equipment or enhancements\nCRAFTING SCENES\nWhenever you start a session, arrive at a new place, or change the situation, tell the players what they need to know by thinking with all of your senses and sharing something unique or unexpected about the fiction.\nENGAGING YOUR PLAYERS\nKeep your players engaged by:\nï¿½ Rotating the Focus between the PCs\nï¿½ Tying Together Story Elements\nï¿½ Engaging Quiet Players\nï¿½ Using Visual Aids\nï¿½ Encouraging Unguided Play\nï¿½ Confronting the PCs with internal and external conflicts\nï¿½ Raise the Stakes by Spending Fear\nï¿½ Layering Goals Other than Attrition into Combat (see Table of Random Objectives on the next page)\n1d12\nObjective\n1\nAcquire (obtain or steal) an important item or items.\n2\nCapture one or more of the opponents.\n3\nActivate a magical device.\n4\nFrame a character or tarnish their reputation.\n5\nDrive the opponent into a corner or ambush point.\n6\nStop a magical ritual, legal ceremony, or timesensitive spell.\n7\nHold the lineï¿½keep the enemy from reaching a specific area or group.\n8\nPlant evidence or a tracking device on a target.\n9\nSecure a specific location ahead of another groupï¿½s arrival.\n10\nHarass the opponent to deplete their resources or keep them occupied.\n11\nDestroy a piece of architecture, a statue, a shrine, or a weapon.\n12\nInvestigate a situation to confirm or deny existing information.\nPHASED BATTLES\nMake battles by shifting the nature of its enemies or environment mid-combat:\nï¿½ Change the Terms of Engagement\nï¿½ Alter the Environment\nï¿½ Evolve the Opposition \nUSING DOWNTIME\nUse downtime scenes as a pressure release valve to vary the intensity of the story and give the PCs room to breathe.\nEmpower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved\nPROJECTS DURING DOWNTIME\nThe Work on a Project downtime move requires more GM input than other downtime moves and is best suited for longterm endeavors the PCs wish to undertake.\nThese projects are typically tracked using a Progress Countdown. When deciding the starting value of the countdown, consider the complexity of the project, the availability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project on the story.\nSimple projects advance their countdown each time a player uses the Work on a Project move, but complex projects require a roll.\nEXTENDED DOWNTIME\nWhen you fast-forward the story across an extended period, use montages to illustrate the passage of time. You gain 1d6 Fear per PC and advance any long-term countdowns as appropriate.\nCAMPAIGN FRAMES\nA campaign frame provides inspiration, tools, and mechanics to support a particular type of story at the table.\nEvery campaign frame has a complexity rating that indicates how much its mechanics deviate from or expand upon the Daggerheart core ruleset.\nEach campaign frame includes the following sections.\nï¿½ A pitch to present to players\nï¿½ Suggestions and guidance on tone, feel, themes, and touchstones\nï¿½ An overview of the campaignï¿½s background\nï¿½ Guidance for fitting communities, ancestries, and classes into the setting\nï¿½ Principles for players and GMs to focus on during the campaign\nï¿½ Unique setting distinctions\nï¿½ An inciting incident to launch the campaign\nï¿½ Special mechanics to use during the campaign\nï¿½ Questions to consider during session zero\nYou can find each campaign frame map in the appendix of the core rulebook or at www.daggerheart.com/downloads.",

    "text": "The Witherwild\nWhen an invading nation attacks an ancient forest deity, a virulent overgrowth spreads throughout the land. \nDesigned by Carlos Cisco, Rowan Hall, & Spenser Starke\nCOMPLEXITY RATING: ï¿½\nTHE PITCH\nRead this section to your players to introduce them to the campaign.\nFanewick was once a place of great abundance and peaceï¿½dangerous to those unfamiliar with the land, but a cornucopia to those who respected its ways. When Haven invaded the wilds and forced the land into eternal spring, a dangerous bloom known as the Witherwild took hold and now threatens the lives of all who live there. In a Witherwild campaign, youï¿½ll play unlikely heroes from humble beginnings who are reckoning with their newfound duty to save Fanewickï¿½s people from dangerous corruption.\nTONE & FEEL\nAdventurous, Dynamic, Epic, Heroic, Thrilling, Uncanny, \nWhimsical\nTHEMES\nCultural Clash, Ends Justify Means, Grief, People vs. \nNature, Transformation and Change, Survival\nTOUCHSTONES\nPrincess Mononoke, The Legend of Zelda, The Dark Crystal, \nNausicaï¿½ of the Valley of the Wind\nOVERVIEW\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nFanewick is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside forces. The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their neighborsï¿½ wars until plague forced the people of Haven to desperate acts.\nHaven was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase ï¿½The Godless Gate.ï¿½ While the original meaning has been \nlost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as Shunï¿½Aush the Granite Ophid. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured Havenï¿½s dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that Haven is known for. \nBut Shunï¿½Aush would have his revenge. As the Havenites carved through his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague. \nOver the last two years, over half of Havenï¿½s populace fell to a disease known as the Serpentï¿½s Sickness. First, victims cough up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. Finally, their body hardensï¿½first the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within the organs, ï¿½the serpentï¿½ moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony.\nThe High Magus of Haven, Archmage Phylax, discovered a rare red flower called the crimson ladyï¿½s veil that could cure the Serpentï¿½s Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across Fanewick in the springï¿½but for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms.\nDesperate to save their people from the plague, Haven invaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of Archmage Phylax, plucked out the Reaping Eye from the most powerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept Fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle of seasonsï¿½of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With her Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick with the Sowing Eye, forcing the land into everlasting spring. \nIn the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the Witherwildï¿½Fanewickï¿½s flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long. \nPrior to the Serpentï¿½s Sickness and the Shepherdï¿½s endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of toil and conquest in Haven. But when the danger demands a response, even the unpreparedï¿½and unwillingï¿½must make a stand.\nCOMMUNITIES\nAll communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero.\n\tLOREBORNE AND HIGHBORNE\nIn Fanewick, knowledge is the most valuable commodity, and those who have expertise have the most power. This economy of information functions primarily through gifting and trading, and wisdom would be considered acceptable collateral for a weapon or warm meal. As such, loreborne community members are the wealthiest in Fanewick and might be smaller, distinct groups of hunters, historians, or artisans within larger villages.\nWhat knowledge did your community teach you that you must now protect or share?\nWhat are you able to accomplish because of your upbringing that others outside your community do not understand?\nYou once traded important knowledge for something terrible. What did you impart and what did you gain in return?  \nIn Haven, the wealthiest members are highborne, having inherited riches built in the walled city over generations. While the highborne of Haven were more insulated from the Serpentï¿½s Sickness, none were immune.\nWho have you lost to the Serpentï¿½s Sickness? How did it affect you?\nHow did your family make their wealth? Have you rejected or embraced their core set of ethics?\nYou grew up in a world of abundance but were kept from learning something about the world. What was this knowledge and when did you discover it?\n\tRIDGEBORNE, UNDERBORNE,  \nAND WILDBORNE\nCharacters from these communities were likely raised in Fanewickï¿½s deadly environs, which have only become more dangerous as the Witherwild grows. Each community has unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret, that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the Faint Divinitiesï¿½ territories.  \nIn exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves and their families, some Wicklings from these groups have been forced to take jobs as farmers in Havenï¿½s flower fields. Though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the Haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild.\nWhat Faint Divinities do you give tribute to, and how have you been rewarded in kind?\nYou displeased a god of Fanewick. What did you do, and what misfortune befell you or a loved one?\nYou fled the place of your birth. What circumstances drove you to leave?\n\tORDERBORNE\nPlayers might choose to build orderborne characters if they want to play current or former members of the Haven Army that invaded Fanewick. Though the army brings violence into this land, they also carry overwhelming grief for a homeland succumbing to disease.\nWhat regrets do you carry with you from your conquest of foreign soil?\nWhat kindness did an enemy combatant bestow upon you in an hour of need? How did this change your view of the people of Fanewick?\nYou were charged with planting a rumor in a Fanewick community. What is the rumor, and do you plan to carry out this mission?\n\tSLYBORNE\nAs the Haven Army is the current martial power in Fanewick, those who wish to play slyborne characters might come from Fanewick rebel groups seeking to expel the invading forces from their lands. Depending on the tactics their group employs, a character from a slyborne community might align with or go against their upbringing.\nWho among the Haven Army do you wish to exact revenge upon and why?\nYou joined an insurgent group working to free this land from Havenï¿½s grasp. What has given you doubts about the leadershipï¿½s methods?\nSomeone you love is a member of the Haven Army. How have you used your position in the rebellion to protect them?\n\tSEABORNE\nBoth Fanewick and Haven have a coastal border. The majority of Fanewickï¿½s seaborne communities live in small seaside groups and focus on local travel to neighboring regions, while Havenites tend to live in large ports that ship and receive goods from distant lands.\nYou recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. What went terribly wrong on that passage, and how has it changed you?\nGrowing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. What did you learn, and how did it save your life?\nYou used to sail with a companion. Who were they, and how do you remain connected?\n\tWANDERBORNE\nWanderborne communities can be found in both Fanewick and Haven, though safe travel has been severely restricted due to the military occupation and the expansion of the Witherwild. Whether a wanderborne character comes from Fanewick, Haven, or elsewhere, the player should determine their characterï¿½s personal views on the invasion of Fanewick, and how that aligns or departs from their communityï¿½s views.\nWhat do you do to keep your small community safe, independent, and hidden from Havenï¿½s forces?\nBecause of your communityï¿½s transience, you have loved ones in both Fanewick and Haven. How has this affected your relationship with the invasion?\nYour community travels to protect something. What is it, and why does it keep you from settling down?\nANCESTRIES\nAll ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players.\n\tCLANKS\nClanks from Haven are commonly made from iron and steel, while clanks from Fanewick are typically constructed from wood and stone.\n\tFUNGRIL\nSince the Witherwild spread throughout Fanewick, some fungril inhabiting the forests have grown noticeably larger than fungril from other regions.\n\tDRAKONA, FAUNS, FIRBOLGS, AND INFERNIS\nAfter the Witherwild corrupted Fanewick, some drakona, fauns, firbolgs, and infernis have noticed their horns growing faster and longer.\n\tGALAPA AND RIBBETS\nMany families of galapa and ribbets who lived in the bogs of Fanewick were displaced when Havenï¿½s army invaded.\nHavenites and the Serpentï¿½s Sickness\nAnyone, but especially those from Haven, may carry the Serpentï¿½s Sickness, which stiffens their movements and gives them limited time to survive without a cure.\nCLASSES\nAll classes are available, but some have unique aspects within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following information to your players.\nDruids, Rangers, and Sorcerers\nDruids, rangers, and sorcerers are commonly found throughout Fanewick. If players choose one of these classes, they should consider how their characterï¿½s connection to the natural world might be impacted by the Witherwild.\nWARRIORS AND WIZARDS\nWarriors and wizards are prevalent in Haven. A large wizarding school in Haven teaches fighters and healers, and the Haven Army is largely composed of warriors and School of War wizards. If a PC is either of these classes, consider their personal relationship to the Haven Army.\nVENGEANCE GUARDIAN\nMany Wicklings who seek revenge on Haven or to expel them from Fanewick become Vengeance guardians. If players choose this subclass, they should consider what ideals or institutions their character protects.\nSYNDICATE ROGUE\nThe Haven Army sends spies into Fanewick communities to gain information on planned attacks and manipulate public perception. When selecting the Syndicate rogue subclass, players should consider how their character might be connected to or impacted by these covert operatives.\nPLAYER PRINCIPLES\nIf your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.\nMAKE THE INVASION PERSONAL\nConsider how Havenï¿½s invasion of Fanewick deeply impacts your character. Let these details inform what they want and what theyï¿½re willing to do to get it. Everyone has lost a loved one to the Witherwild or the Serpentï¿½s Sickness, and more are dying by the day. Consider how the growing conflict caused your character to act in ways they arenï¿½t proud of, or transformed personal truths they once believed were unshakable.\nTREAT DEATH WITH IMPORTANCE\nTaking a life should not be done without consideration, desperation, and consequences. As your character journeys, they should remember those theyï¿½ve lost and those theyï¿½ve slain, allowing each death to affect their choices in the future. \nEMBRACE VULNERABILITY\nFind your characterï¿½s humanity and showcase it whenever you can. They should be as vulnerable during quiet moments as they are vicious during violent ones, opening up to their allies even if they close themself off to everyone else.\nGM PRINCIPLES\nKeep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.\n\tPAINT THE WORLD IN CONTRAST\nSubvert expectations by giving space for the nightmarish to charm and the beautiful to terrify. Give the PCs visions of the natural beauty of Fanewick that has run roughshod across the region, breaking the bounds of the bogs and forests and devastating homes and communities. Show the grim and ordered life behind Havenï¿½s walls, but also show the culture, art, and progress that has come out of centuries of safety. Contrast the capricious nature of the Faint Divinities with the devotion of the Wicklings and Havenites fighting to save their home. In a place of long nights and days, dual seasons, and two nations in conflict, look for ways to highlight bold dualities.\n\tSHOW THEM TRUE DANGER\nThough it may be tragic, bodily harm is not the worst tragedy that can befall the characters. To illustrate whatï¿½s truly at stake, use the PCsï¿½ origins in Fanewick or Haven to show them what they stand to lose, be it their homes, family, friends, communities, or even their core truths and beliefs. The events of this campaign may change, threaten, or destroy these aspects of their pastï¿½when your players create and are invested in their characterï¿½s backstory, they have something to fight for.\n\tOFFER ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE\nBy illuminating nonviolent approaches to problem-solving, the PCs can help break the brutal cycle that binds this world. For example, showing compassionï¿½rather than swordpointï¿½ to a corrupted beast can free them from the Witherwild. Similarly, the conflict between Haven and Fanewick shouldnï¿½t only be solved with blood and blade. What threatens both could also unify them. Give the PCs opportunities to mend old wounds, right past wrongs, and heal the rift between Haven and Fanewick from within.\nCREATE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ALLIES AND \nADVERSARIES\nNo adversary or ally is all good or all bad, and they each have multidimensional lives. Even the most congenial ally should be hiding darkness inside them, hoping their failings will go undiscovered. Those painted as evil should sometimes do the right thing, even if itï¿½s for the wrong reason. Just because a PC or NPC is from Haven doesnï¿½t make them a villain, and, conversely, not all the inhabitants of Fanewick are virtuous. Finding the nuance, complications, and deeper motivations of the people of Haven and Fanewick will lead to richer interactions, more complex moral choices, and a deeper sense of attachment to the world for the players. \nDISTINCTIONS\nUse this information to prepare your campaign. You can also share it with your players as needed.\n\tTHE WEEKS OF DAY AND NIGHT\nThe day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises for an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same length. This has an impact on everything from agriculture to trade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night. \nBut this cycle doesnï¿½t just affect Wicklings, itï¿½s dictated how Fanewickï¿½s wondrous ecology has evolved. Days and nights are accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes as Fanewickï¿½s nocturnal denizens sleep through the long days and stalk the woods in times of darkness while their diurnal counterparts sleep. The plants similarly live on this strange day-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a week. Sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the tree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the light of the moon. Conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent flower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay, only blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of forestï¿½a godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark.\n\tTHE SERPENTï¿½S SICKNESS\nThe plague sweeping across Haven spares no one. Since the initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of crimson ladyï¿½s veil, many citizens began to carry or consume all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to protect or cure themselves. \nIn the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique and painful pattern that resembles a snakeï¿½s skin. Not long after, the victimsï¿½ bodies harden until their organs solidify and cease to function. The final stages of the Serpentï¿½s Sickness is so quick that many transform into statues where they stand, leaving all of Haven a cenotaph to a once-great power.\n\tLADYï¿½S VEIL\nThese small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout Fanewick. For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled flowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even so, they were only foraged until the Havenites discovered crimson ladyï¿½s veilï¿½the only known cure for Serpentï¿½s Sickness. \nThus, the Haven Army invaded Fanewick and began cultivating the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the regionï¿½s bogs. Though the theft of the Reaping Eye has created an indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare, and Fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the Haven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the Serpentï¿½s Sickness. \n\tTHE WITHERWILD\nThis corruption, empowered by the endless spring, is spreading throughout Fanewick. Some believe the overgrowth began in the forest, while others claim it sprang from the bogs. But no matter its origins, this flourishing malignancy induces horrific changes and massive growth on anything it touches, transforming them into Withered beings. Plants spring to life with a desire to consume all around them. Animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and claws. Even harmless creatures that were once hunted for food have become dangerous and formidable adversaries. \nWhen a person is corrupted by the Witherwild, either from a purposeful attack or accidental harm (see the upcoming ï¿½Corruption from the Witherwildï¿½ section), they are transformed. They become a nightmarish hybridï¿½their body warped and intertwined with plant or beast. The Witherwild slowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same drive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted Fanewick. Though the Withered may retain a semblance of who they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of their personhood. Some Wicklings believe the Withered are gifted this power by Niktaï¿½s wrath to drive the forces of Haven from Fanewick and return the Shepherdï¿½s Reaping Eye.\n\tTHE GODS OF FANEWICK\nGods in this land arenï¿½t ethereal concepts that exist in another realm; instead, they wander the land as incarnate beings, residing in both the natural world as well as within homes and small villages. As such, theyï¿½re generally present in Wicklingsï¿½ lives. Many communities, and some larger families, even have their own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them. \nBelief and worship take on a different meaning in Fanewickï¿½ there is a constant push and pull between the goals of people and their deific neighbors. The gods must curry worship from mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service, or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe when traveling and working in Fanewick. The most powerful and widely acknowledged Faint Divinity is the Shepherd of Seasons, Nikta, as the loss of her eye had the most recent and visible impact on everyone in Fanewick.\nFanewickï¿½s various divinities each have their own opinion concerning the Witherwild corruption. While some enjoy natureï¿½s newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are wary of how out of balance Fanewick has become. While their behavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are more accessible than gods who watch from on high. \nFulg, Stacker of Stones: A small god who favors tribute in the form of smooth, stacked river rocks. Under his power, bivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they can be easily harvested. He is largely uninformed about the problems Fanewick faces, and he prefers it that way.\nHyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms: A friend of bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the Witherwild after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) to immense proportions. Theyï¿½re enjoying this rampant growth and do not see a reason to end it.\nIkla, the Sky Painter: Iklaï¿½s artistic prowess and talent are unmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and sunset over Fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors. They could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their demeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone would ask a favor of them during their time off.\nOove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom: He is one of the few local gods who has never been seen, but he is often heard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost travelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night bloom. Locals claim he leads those who displease him or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. Itï¿½s rumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his home on the moon.\nQuiï¿½Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End: A quiet god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in thorny bushes and briar patches. Traditionally, she doesnï¿½t receive many visitors, but the Witherwildï¿½s corruptive growth has made her job harder and upended her quiet existence.\nRohkin, the Wandering Horn: Rohkin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick. In happier times, he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the corruption of the Witherwild has taken hold, heï¿½s seen his herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts.\nThese are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Faint Divinities lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing throughout Fanewick.  \nWhat Faint Divinities do the PCs acknowledge and pay tribute to, if any?\nHow has the Witherwild changed the outlook, personality, and dispositions of the Faint Divinities the characters encounter?\nWhich gods ally themselves with Haven to preserve the endless spring? Which align with Fanewick?\nTHE INCITING INCIDENT\nYou can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own.\nThe Reaping Eye is stowed in a secure vault beneath the central tower of Havenï¿½s wizarding school, seemingly impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group, led by a mysterious figure known only as the Fanewraith (she/ her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the Witherwild: find the Great Owl, Nikta, and pluck out the Sowing Eye. While this may solve the immediate problem, the long-term consequences are not being considered, just as they werenï¿½t when Haven invaded. \nHavenï¿½s beleaguered spymaster, Kreil Dirn (he/him), is not a popular person in Haven. He is responsible for rooting out insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to start, and keeping a close watch on Havenï¿½s internal activities. Kreil has never agreedï¿½at least not openlyï¿½with Archmage Phylaxï¿½s (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and the consequences theyï¿½ve all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating. \nRecently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraithï¿½s plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. Knowing he canï¿½t send a troop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice.\nThe party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with Kreil. But is his information correct? Does he have his own motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from Fanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the ï¿½enemyï¿½ they pursue. And what will they do when they find the Fanewraith? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to recover the Reaping Eye?\nKreil advises the party to start their hunt for the Fanewraith in the treetop village of Alula, where he suspects she runs her operation.\nCAMPAIGN MECHANICS\nThe following mechanics are unique to this campaign.\n\tCORRUPTION FROM THE WITHERWILD\nAdversaries and environments in this campaign can gain an additional type called Withered. When an adversary is Withered, describe how the Witherwild changed or impacted how they would normally appear or operate. You also need about 20 Wither tokens (these can be the same as the tokens you use for Fear). \nAny time a PC takes Severe damage from a Withered adversary or environment, gain a Wither token and place it on that PCï¿½s character sheet. When you do, the PC must roll their Fear Die. If they roll equal to or below the number of Wither tokens on their sheet, they immediately gain a scar and clear all tokens, describing how the Witherwild changes them permanently.\nAt the end of each session, clear all Wither tokens from the PCsï¿½ sheets and gain an equal amount of Fear. If a character ever dies with Wither tokens on their sheet, their body is permanently taken over by the Witherwild. \nSESSION ZERO QUESTIONS\nAsk any of these questions to your players, or make your own.\nWhat dangerous animal comes out during the week of night that isnï¿½t out during the week of day?\nWhat unique trait (such as appearance, smell, or taste) does anything tainted by the Witherwild have? \nWhat superstitions does your character or their community have about traversing Fanewick during the long nights?\nYour character has witnessed something beautiful that came from the Witherwild. What is it and how has it transformed their view of the corruption?\n\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 3\n\n\n\n\n\n112 \tDaggerheart SRD\n\n\tDaggerheart SRD\t 113\n\n\n\n\n\n",
