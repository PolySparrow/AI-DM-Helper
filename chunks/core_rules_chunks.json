    "text": "what is daggerheart? daggerheart is a tabletop roleplaying game for one game master (gm) and 2-5 players. each game session lasts about 2-4 hours, and daggerheart can be played as a one-shot or a multi-session campaign of any length. during a session of daggerheart the gm describes situations, narrates events, and controls any adversaries or obstacles that the player characters (pcs) encounter. the players, in turn, roleplay their pcs reactions to the scenario presented by the gm. if the outcome of a players action depends on fate or fortune, the gm calls for an action roll. when a player makes an action roll, they utilize duality dicetwo differently colored 12-sided dice (d12s) representing hope and fear. the duality dice are rolled, relevant modifiers are added to the results, and the total is compared to a difficulty set by the gm. if the total meets or beats the difficulty, the player succeeds. if its lower, they fail. in addition, the situation changes based on which duality die rolls higher, either giving the player helpful hope tokens or generating terrifying fear tokens for the gm.the golden rule the most important rule of daggerheart is to make the game your own. the rules included in this srd are designed to help you enjoy the experience at the table, but everyone has a different approach to interpreting rules and telling stories. the rules should never get in the way of the story you want to tell, the characters you want to play, or the adventures you want to have. as long as your group agrees, everything can be adjusted to fit your play style. if theres a rule youd rather ignore or modify, feel free to implement any change with your tables consent. rulings over rules while playing daggerheart, the gm and players should always prioritize rulings over rules. this srd offers answers for many questions your table may have about the game, but it wont answer all of them. when youre in doubt about how a rule applies, the gm should make a ruling that aligns with the narrative. for example, daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that lets you pull a target close to you. if you try to use it to pull an entire castle, the weapon text doesnt forbid you from doing thatbut it doesnt make sense within the narrative. instead, the gm might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull yourself toward the wall instead. similarly, if your character does something that would logically result in immediate deathsuch as diving into an active volcano without protectionyou might not get to make one of daggerhearts death moves, which normally give you control of your characters fate in their final moments. this kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world. as a narrative-focused game, daggerheart is not a place where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are encouraged. everything should flow back to the fiction, and the gm has the authority and responsibility to make rulings about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction. 3 daggerheart srd"

    "text": "unless their table chooses to use pre-generated characters, each player creates their own pc by making a series of guided choices. some of these decisions are purely narrative, meaning they only appear in or affect the game through roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the things their pc is able to do and which actions theyre more (or less) likely to succeed at when making moves and taking action. note: you can fill in your characters name, pronouns, and character description details at any point of the character creation process. step 1 choose a class and subclass. classes are role-based archetypes that determine which class features and domain cards a pc gains access to throughout the campaign. there are nine classes in this srd: bard, druid, guardian, ranger, rogue, seraph, sorcerer, warrior, wizard. select a class and take its corresponding character sheet and character guide printouts. these sheets are for recording your pcs details; youll update and reference them throughout the campaign. every class begins with one or more unique class feature(s), described at the bottom left of each classs character sheet. if your class feature prompts you to make a selection, do so now. choose a subclass subclasses further refine a class archetype and reinforce its expression by granting access to unique subclass features. each class comprises two subclasses. select one of your classs subclasses and take its foundation card. step 2 choose your heritage. your characters heritage combines two elements: ancestry and community. a characters ancestry reflects their lineage, impacting their physicality and granting them two unique ancestry features. take the card for one of the following ancestries, then write its name in the heritage field of your character sheet: clank, drakona, dwarf, elf, faerie, faun, firbolg, fungril, galapa, giant, goblin, halfling, human, infernis, katari, orc, ribbet, simiah. t o create a mixed ancestry, take the top (first-listed) ancestry feature from one ancestry and the bottom (second-listed) ancestry feature from another. your characters community represents their culture or environment of origin and grants them a community feature. take the card for one of the following communities, then write its name in the heritage field of your character sheet: highborne, loreborne, orderborne, ridgeborne, seaborne, slyborne, underborne, wanderborne, wildborne.step 3 assign character traits. your character has six traits that represent their physical, mental, and social aptitude: agility (use it to sprint, leap, maneuver,etc.) a high agility means youre fast on your feet, nimble on difficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. youll make an agility roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or bound from rooftop to rooftop. strength (use it to lift, smash, grapple, etc.) a high strength means youre better at feats that test your physical prowess and stamina. youll make a strength roll to break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your ground against a charging foe. finesse (use it to control, hide, tinker, etc.) a high finesse means youre skilled at tasks that require accuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. youll make a finesse roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with precision. instinct (use it to perceive, sense, navigate, etc.) a high instinct means you have a keen sense of your surroundings and a natural intuition. youll make an instinct roll to sense danger, notice details in the world around you, or track an elusive foe. presence (use it to charm, perform, deceive, etc.) a high presence means you have a strong force of personality and a facility for social situations. youll make a presence roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or capture the attention of a crowd. knowledge (use it to recall, analyze, comprehend, etc.) a high knowledge means you know information others dont and understand how to apply your mind through deduction and inference. youll make a knowledge roll to interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember important information. when you roll with a trait, that traits modifier is added to the rolls total. assign the modifiers +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1 to your characters traits in any order you wish. step 4 record additional character information. characters start a new campaign at level 1. record your level in the designated space at the top of your character sheet. evasion represents your characters ability to avoid damage. your characters starting evasion is determined by their class and appears directly beneath the evasion field on your character sheet; copy this number into the evasion field. hit points (hp) are an abstract measure of your physical health. your starting hp is determined by your class and is recorded on your character sheet. 4 daggerheart srd stress reflects your ability to withstand the mental and emotional strain of dangerous situations and physical exertion. every pc starts with 6 stress slots. hope is a metacurrency that fuels special moves and certain abilities or features. all pcs start with 2 hope; mark these in the hope field of your character sheet. step 5 choose your starting equipment choose your weapon(s): select from the tier 1 weapon tables. either a two- handed primary weapon or a one-handed primary weapon and a one-handed secondary weapon.then equip your selection by recording it in the active weapon field of your character sheet. at level 1, your proficiency is 1; write this number in the proficiency field on your character sheet, then calculate and record your damage roll by combining your proficiency value with your equipped weapon(s) damage dice. example: if your proficiency is 1 and your weapons damage dice is d6+1, your damage roll is 1d6+1. proficiency only determines how many damage dice you roll, and does not affect any flat damage modifiers. choose and equip one set of armor from the tier 1 armor table, then record its details in the active armor field of your character sheet. add your characters level to your equipped armors base thresholds and record the total for both numbers in the corresponding fields. at character creation, your level is 1. record your armor score in the field at the top left of your character sheet. your armor score is equal to your equipped armors base score plus any permanent bonuses your character has to their armor score from other abilities, features, or effects. add the following items to the inventory fields on your character sheet: a torch, 50 feet of rope, basic supplies, and a handful of gold (mark one box in the left-hand column of your character sheet titled gold > handfuls) either a minor health potion (clear 1d4 hit points) or a minor stamina potion (clear 1d4 stress) one of the class-specific items listed on your character guide if applicable, whichever class-specific item you selected to carry your spells any other gm-approved items youd like to have at the start of the gamestep 6 create your background. develop your characters background by answering the background questions in your character guide, modifying or replacing them if they dont fit the character you want to play. note: your background has no explicit mechanical effect, but it greatly affects the character youll play and the prep the gm will do. throughout character creation, you can adjust choices you made in earlier steps to better reflect this background as your character takes shape. if you wish, you can leave your characters past more ambiguous for the time being and discover their backstory through play. step 7 create your experiences. an experience is a word or phrase used to encapsulate a specific set of skills, personality traits, or aptitudes your character has acquired over the course of their life. when your pc makes a move, they can spend a hope to add a relevant experiences modifier to an action or reaction roll. your pc gets two experiences at character creation, each with a +2 modifier. theres no set list of experiences to choose from, but an experience cant be too broadly applicable and it cant grant your character specific mechanical benefits, such as magic spells or special abilities. for example, lucky and highly skilled are too broad, because they could be applied to virtually any roll. likewise, supersonic flight and invulnerable imply game-breaking special abilities. example experiences backgrounds: assassin, blacksmith, bodyguard, bounty hunter, chef to the royal family, circus performer, con artist, fallen monarch, field medic, high priestess, merchant, noble, pirate, politician, runaway, scholar, sellsword, soldier, storyteller, thief, world traveler characteristics: affable, battle-hardened, bookworm, charming, cowardly, friend to all, helpful, intimidating presence, leader, lone wolf, loyal, observant, prankster, silver t ongue, sticky fingers, stubborn to a fault, survivor, young and naive specialties: acrobat, gambler, healer, inventor, magical historian, mapmaker, master of disguise, navigator, sharpshooter, survivalist, swashbuckler, t actician skills: animal whisperer, barter, deadly aim, fast learner, incredible strength, liar, light feet, negotiator, photographic memory, quick hands, repair, scavenger, tracker phrases: catch me if you can, fake it till you make it, first times the charm, hold the line, i wont let you down, ill catch you, ive got your back, knowledge is power, natures friend, never again, no one left behind, pick on someone your own size, the show must go on, this is not a negotiation, wolf in sheeps clothing 5 daggerheart srd step 8 choose domain cards. your class has access to two of the nine domains included in the core set. choose two cards from your classs domains, which are listed in the upper left of your character sheet. you can take one card from each domain or two from a single domain, whichever you prefer. step 9 create your connections. connections are the relationships between the pcs. t o create connections, follow these steps: go around the table and have each player describe their characters to one anotherat a minimum, their name, pronouns, character description, experiences, and the answers to their background questions. discuss potential connections between the pcs using the questions included in the connections section of your character guide as inspiration. suggest at least one connection between your character and each other players pc. accept any suggested connections you want to explore, reject any you dont. note: a player can reject a suggested connection for any reason, and its okay if there isnt an established connection between every pair of pcsyou can always discover and develop those relationships through play. 6 daggerheart srd"

whether by steel, bow, or perhaps a more specialized arm, those who follow this path have the skill to cut short the lives of others. wielders of blade dedicate themselves to achieving inexorable power over death. the blade domain can be accessed by the guardian and warrior classes. bone bone is the domain of tactics and the body. practitioners of this domain have an uncanny control over their

by the ranger & warrior classes. codex codex is the domain of intensive magical study. those who seek magical knowledge turn to the equations of power recorded in books, written on scrolls, etched into walls, or tattooed on bodies. codex offers a commanding and versatile understanding of magic to devotees who pursue knowledge beyond the boundaries of common wisdom. the codex domain can be accessed by the bard and wizard classes. grace grace is the domain of charisma. through rapturous storytelling, charming spells, or a shroud of lies, those who channel this power define the realities of their adversaries, bending perception to their will. grace offers its wielders raw magnetism and mastery over language. the grace domain can be accessed by the bard and rogue classesmidnight midnight is the domain of shadows and secrecy. whether by clever tricks, deft magic, or the cloak of night, those who channel these forces practice the art of obscurity and can uncover sequestered treasures. midnight offers practitioners the power to control and create enigmas. the midnight domain can be access by the rogue and sorcerer classes. sage sage is the domain of the natural world.

ranger: bone & sage rogue: grace & midnight seraph: splendor & valor sorcerer: arcana & midnight warrior: blade & bone wizard: codex & splendor pcs acquire two 1st-level domain cards at character creation and an additional domain card at or below their level each time they level up. 7 daggerheart srd domain cards each domain card provides one or more features your pc can utilize during their adventures. some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. others offer passive effects, new downtime or social encounter abilities, or one-time benefits. domain card anatomy each domain card includes six elements: level the number in the top left of the card indicates the cards level. you cannot acquire a domain card with a level higher than your pcs. domain beneath the cards level there is a symbol indicating its domain. you can only choose cards from your classs two domains. recall cost the number and lightning bolt in the top right of the card shows its recall cost. this is the amount of stress a player must mark to swap this card from their vault with a card from their loadout. note: a player can swap domain cards during downtime without paying the domain cards recall cost. title the name of the card. type the cards type is listed in the center above the title. there are three types of domain cards: abilities, spells, and grimoires. abilities are typically non-magical in nature, while spells are magical. grimoires are unique to the codex domain and grant access to a collection of less potent spells. some game mechanics only apply to certain types of cards. feature the text on the bottom half of the card describes its feature(s), including any special rules you need to follow when you use that card. loadout & vault your loadout is the set of acquired domain cards whose effects your pc can use during play. you can have up to 5 domain cards in your loadout at one time. once youve acquired six or more domain cards, you must choose five to keep in your loadout; the rest are considered to be in your vault. vault cards are inactive and do not influence play note: your subclass, ancestry, and community cards dont count toward your loadout or vault and are always active and available. at the start of a rest, before using downtime moves, you can freely move cards between your loadout and your vault, so long as your loadout doesnt exceed its five-card maximum. t o move a card from your vault to your loadout at any other time, you must mark a number of stress equal to the vaulted cards recall cost (located in the top right of the card next to the lightning bolt symbol). if your loadout is already full, you must also move a card from your loadout to your vault to make space, though you can do this at no cost. when you gain a new domain card at level-up, you can immediately move it into your loadout for free. if your loadout is already full, you must also move a card from your loadout to your vault to make space. usage limits if a domain card restricts how often it can be used, you can track such limits with whatever method you prefer, such as turning the card sideways, flipping it facedown, or using tokens. note: if an effect or ability gives you a number of uses equal to a trait with a modifier of +0 or less, it grants you 0 uses."

materials: bard, druid, guardian, ranger, rogue, seraph, sorcerer, warrior, and wizard. subclasses each class is divided into two subclasses, each of which further defines and highlights one aspect of its class archetype. your chosen subclass grants the following: spellcast trait: the trait used on all spellcast rolls. foundation feature: a unique starting feature that establishes the identity and strengths of the subclass. specialization feature: an advanced feature that can be gained on level up. for some subclasses, the specialization feature grants a new ability; for others, it expands or enhances a feature you already acquired through a class or subclass. mastery feature: the mastery feature is a subclasss most powerful feature, which can be gained at higher levels. for some subclasses, the mastery feature unlocks an extraordinary new ability; for others, its the impressive culmination of their subclasss core feature. the daggerheart core set includes cards detailing each foundation, specialization, and mastery feature. when you acquire one of these features, take its card for use as a reference during play. 8 daggerheart srd bard bards are the most charismatic people in all the realms. members of this class are masters of captivation and specialize in a variety of performance types, including singing, playing musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. whether performing for an audience or speaking to an individual, bards thrive in social situations. members of this profession bond and train at schools or guilds, but a current of egotism runs through those of the bardic persuasion. while they may be the most likely class to bring people together, a bard of ill temper can just as easily tear a party apart. domains - grace & codex starting

questions. what made you realize we were going to be such good friends? what do i do that annoys you? why do you grab my hand at night?druid becoming a druid is more than an occupation; its a calling for those who wish to learn from and protect the magic of the wilderness. while one might underestimate a gentle druid who practices the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who channel the untamed forces of nature are terrifying to behold. druids cultivate their abilities in small groups, often connected by a specific ethos or locale, but some choose to work alone. through years of study and dedication, druids can learn to transform into beasts and shape nature itself. domains - sage & arcana starting evasion - 10 starting hit points - 6 class items - a small bag of rocks and bones or a strange pendant found in the dirt druids hope feature evolution: spend 3 hope to transform into a beastform without marking a stress. when you do, choose one trait to raise by +1 until you

last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as normal. additionally, you gain the beastforms features, add their evasion bonus to your evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for your attack. while youre in a beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark armor slots as usual; when you drop out of a beastform, those marked armor slots remain marked. if you mark your last hit point, you automatically drop out of this form. wildtouch: you can perform harmless, subtle effects that involve naturesuch as causing a flower to rapidly grow,

connections ask your fellow players one of the following questions for their character to answer, or create your own questions. what did you confide in me that makes me leap into danger for you every time? what animal do i say you remind me of? what affectionate nickname have you given me? 11 daggerheart srd beastform options when you use your beastform feature, choose a creature category of your tier or lower. at the gms discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category. beastform categories are divided by tier. each entry includes the following details: creature category: each categorys name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as agile scout). this name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel). character trait: while transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. for example, while transformed into an agile scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your agility. when this form drops, you lose this bonus. attack rolls: when you make an attack while transformed, you use the creatures listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your proficiency. for example, as an agile scout, you can attack a target within melee range using your agility. on a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your proficiency. evasion: while transformed, you add the creatures evasion bonus to your normal evasion. for example, if your evasion is usually 8 and your beastform says evasion +2, your evasion becomes 10 while youre in that form. advantages: your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. when you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. for example, an agile scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities. features: each form includes unique features. for example, an agile scout excels at silent, dexterous movementbut theyre also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of beastform. tier 1 agile scout (fox, mouse, weasel, etc.) agility +1 | evasion +2 melee

or individual study, those known as wizards acquire and hone immense magical power over years of learning using a variety of tools, including books, stones, potions, and herbs. some wizards dedicate their lives to mastering a particular school of magic, while others learn from a wide variety of disciplines. many wizards become wise and powerful figures in their communities, advising rulers, providing medicines and healing, and even leading war councils. while these mages all work toward the common goal of collecting magical knowledge, wizards often have the most conflict within their own

    "text": "ancestries represent your characters lineage, which affects their physical appearance and access to certain special abilities. the following section describes each ancestry in daggerheart and the characteristics generally shared by members of that ancestry, however, each player decides how much their character aligns with the standard or average expression of their ancestry. in daggerheart, the term people is used to refer to all ancestries, as individuals from all lineages possess unique characteristics and cultures, as well as personhood. some ancestries are described using the term humanoid. this does not imply any genetic relation to humans, which is a distinct ancestry within daggerheart. instead, it refers to the set of physical characteristics humans will recognize from their own anatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright posture, facial layout, and more. these traits vary by ancestry and individual, though humanoid should still provide a useful frame of reference. the core ruleset includes the following ancestries: clank, drakona, dwarf, elf, faerie, faun, firbolg, fungril, galapa, giant, goblin, halfling, human, infernis, katari, orc, ribbet, simiah, and mixed ancestry. ancestry features each ancestry grants two ancestry features. while some features (such as the ability to fly) are implicitly tied to an ancestrys anatomy, players determine their characters physical form. work with the gm to re-flavor any implied traits that dont align with your character concept. if youd like to make a character who combines more than one ancestry, see mixed ancestry. clank clanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety of materials, including metal, wood, and stone. they can resemble humanoids, animals, or even inanimate objects. like organic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes. because of their bespoke construction, many clanks have highly specialized physical configurations. examples include clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry. many clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as function, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank artisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical adornments. other ancestries can create clanks, even using their own physical characteristics as inspiration, but its also common for clanks to build one another. a clanks lifespan extends as long as theyre able to acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. that said, their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate as the magic that powers them loses potency.ancestry features purposeful design: decide who made you and for what purpose. at character creation, choose one of your experiences that best aligns with this purpose and gain a permanent +1 bonus to it. efficient: when you take a short rest, you can choose a long rest move instead of a short rest move. drakona drakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form and possess a powerful elemental breath. all drakona have thick scales that provide excellent natural armor against both attacks and the forces of nature. they are large in size, ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average, with long sharp teeth. new teeth grow throughout a drakonas approximately 350-year lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona dont have wings and cant fly without magical aid. members of this ancestry pass down the element of their breath through generations, though in rare cases, a drakonas elemental power will differ from the rest of their familys. ancestry features scales: your scales act as natural protection. when you would take severe damage, you can mark a stress to mark 1 fewer hit points. elemental breath: choose an element for your breath (such as electricity, fire, or ice). you can use this breath against a target or group of targets within very close range, treating it as an instinct weapon that deals d8 magic damage using your proficiency. dwarf dwarves are most easily recognized as short humanoids with square frames, dense musculature, and thick hair. their average height ranges from 4 to 5 feet, and they are often broad in proportion to their stature. their skin and nails contain a high amount of keratin, making them naturally resilient. this allows dwarves to embed gemstones into their bodies and decorate themselves with tattoos or piercings. their hair grows thicklyusually on their heads, but some dwarves have thick hair across their bodies as well. dwarves of all genders can grow facial hair, which they often style in elaborate arrangements. typically, dwarves live up to 250 years of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life. ancestry features thick skin: when you take minor damage, you can mark 2 stress instead of marking a hit point. increased fortitude: spend 3 hope to halve incoming physical damage. 27 daggerheart srd elf elves are typically tall humanoids with pointed ears and acutely attuned senses. their ears vary in size and pointed shape, and as they age, the tips begin to droop. while elves come in a wide range of body types, they are all fairly tall, with heights ranging from about 6 to 6 feet. all elves have the ability to drop into a celestial trance, rather than sleep. this allows them to rest effectively in a short amount of time. some elves possess what is known as a mystic form, which occurs when an elf has dedicated themself to the study or protection of the natural world so deeply that their physical form changes. these characteristics can include celestial freckles, the presence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their hair, eyes that flicker like fire, and more. sometimes these traits are inherited from parents, but if an elf changes their environment or magical focus, their appearance changes over time. because elves live for about 350 years, these traits can shift more than once throughout their lifespan. ancestry features quick reactions: mark a stress to gain advantage on a reaction roll. celestial trance: during a rest, you can drop into a trance to choose an additional downtime move. faerie faeries are winged humanoid creatures with insectile features. these characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid to insectoidsome possess additional arms, compound eyes, lantern organs, chitinous exoskeletons, or stingers. because of their close ties to the natural world, they also frequently possess attributes that allow them to blend in with various plants. the average height of a faerie ranges from about 2 feet to 5 feet, but some faeries grow up to 7 feet tall. all faeries possess membranous wings and they each go through a process of metamorphosis. the process and changes differ from faerie to faerie, but during this transformation each individual manifests the unique appearance they will carry throughout the rest of their approximately 50-year lifespan. ancestry feature luckbender: once per session, after you or a willing ally within close range makes an action roll, you can spend 3 hope to reroll the duality dice. wings: you can fly. while flying, you can mark a stress after an adversary makes an attack against you to gain a +2 bonus to your evasion against that attack.faun fauns resemble humanoid goats with curving horns, square pupils, and cloven hooves. though their appearances may vary, most fauns have a humanoid torso and a goatlike lower body covered in dense fur. faun faces can be more caprine

feet tall, but their height can change dramatically from one moment to the next based on their stance. the majority of fauns have proportionately long limbs, no matter their size or shape, and are known for their ability to deliver powerful blows with their split hooves. fauns live for roughly 225 years, and as they age, their appearance can become increasingly goatlike. ancestry features caprine leap: you can leap anywhere within close range as though you were using normal movement, allowing you to vault obstacles, jump across gaps, or scale barriers with ease. kick: when you succeed on an attack against a target within melee range, you can mark a stress to kick yourself off them, dealing an extra 2d6 damage and knocking back either yourself or the target to very close range. firbolg firbolgs are bovine humanoids typically recognized by their broad noses and long, drooping ears. some have faces that are a blend of humanoid and bison, ox, cow, or other bovine creatures. others, often referred to as minotaurs, have heads that entirely resemble cattle. they are tall and muscular creatures, with heights ranging from around 5 feet to 7 feet, and possess remarkable strength no matter their age. some firbolgs are known to use this strength to charge their adversaries, an action that is particuarly effective for those who have one of the many varieties of horn styles commonly found in this ancestry. though their unique characteristics can vary, all firbolgs are covered in fur, which can be muted and earth-toned in color, or come in a variety of pastels, such as soft pinks and blues. on average, firbolgs live for about 150 years. ancestry features charge: when you succeed on an agility roll to move from far or very far range into melee range with one

staggering 7 feet tall. while the common lifespan of a fungril is about 300 years, some have been reported to live much longer. they can communicate nonverbally, and many members of this ancestry use

shell's strength or appearance by attaching armor or carving unique designs, but the process is exceedingly painful. most galapa move slowly no matter their age, and they can live approximately 150 years. ancestry features shell: gain a bonus to your damage thresholds equal to your proficiency. retract: mark a stress to retract into your shell. while in your shell, you have resistance to physical damage, you have disadvantage on action rolls, and you cant move. giant giants are towering humanoids with broad shoulders, long arms, and one to three eyes. adult giants range from 6 to 8 feet tall and are naturally muscular, regardless of body type. they are easily recognized by their wide frames and elongated arms and necks. though they can have up to three eyes, all giants are born with none and remain sightless for their first year of life. until a giant reaches the age of 10 and their features fully develop, the formation of their eyes may fluctuate. those with a single eye

incredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant or subdued, more dominant than another. a typical goblin stands between 3 feet and 4 feet tall, and each of their ears is about the size of their

or a variety of other factors. if you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple ancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the game, use the steps below: 1. determine ancestry combination when you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down how your character identifies themself in the heritage section of your character sheet. for example, if your character is descended from both goblins and orcs, you could use a hybridized term, such as goblin-orc, to describe your ancestry, list only the ancestry you more closely identify with (e.g., just goblin or just orc), or invent a new term, such as toothling. 2. choose ancestry features work with your gm to choose two features from the ancestries in your characters lineage. you must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet. for example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the surefooted and tusks features or the sturdy and danger sense features. you cant take both the surefooted and sturdy features, because these are both the first features listed on their respective ancestry cards. your character's heritage might include more than two ancestries, but you still only choose features from two. you can represent additional ancestries through their appearance or backstory. 31 daggerheart srd"

    "text": "daggerheart is a conversation. the gm describes fictional scenarios involving the pcs, and the players take turns describing how their characters react. the goal of every person at the table is to build upon everyone elses ideas and collaboratively tell a satisfying story. the system facilitates this collaborative process by providing structure to the conversation and mechanics for resolving moments of tension where fate or fortune determine the outcome of events. pla yer principles & best practices t o get the most out of daggerheart, we recommend players keep the following principles and practices in mind throughout each session: principles be a fan of your character and their journey. spotlight your friends. address the characters and address the players. build the world together. play to find out what happens. hold on gently. best practices embrace danger. use your resources. t ell the story. discover your character. for more information, see the daggerheart core rulebook, pages 9 and 108. core gameplay loop the core gameplay loop is the procedure that drives every scene, both in and out of combat: step 1: set the scene the gm describes a scenario, establishing the pcs surroundings and any dangers, npcs, or other important details the characters would notice.step 2 ask and answer questions the players ask clarifying questions to explore the scene more deeply and gather information that could inform their characters actions. the gm responds to these questions by giving the players information their characters could easily obtain, or by asking questions of their own to the players. the players also respond to any questions the gm poses to them. in this way, the table builds out the fiction collaboratively. step 3 build on the fiction as the scene develops, the players find opportunities to take actionproblems to solve, obstacles to overcome, mysteries to investigate, and so on. the players describe how their characters proceed; if their proposed actions carry no chance of failure (or if failure would be boring), they automatically succeed. but if the outcome of their action is unknown, the gm calls for an action roll. either way, the table works the outcome into the story and moves the fiction forward, narrating how the pcs actions have changed things. step 4 go back to step 1 the process repeats from the beginning, with the gm relaying any updated details or material changes to the players. this process continues until the end of the scene is triggered by a mechanic or arrives organically."

    "text": "the spotlight is a symbol that represents the tables attentionand therefore the immediate focus of both the narrative and the game mechanics. any time a character or player becomes the focus of a scene, they are in the spotlight or have the spotlight. the spotlight moves around the table organically as scenes unfold unless a mechanical trigger determines where the spotlight goes next. for example, when a player fails an action roll, the mechanics prompt the gm to seize the spotlight and make a gm move. 35 daggerheart srd turn order & action economy daggerhearts turns dont follow a traditional, rigid format: there is no explicit initiative mechanic and characters dont have a set number of actions they can take or things they can do before the spotlight passes to someone else. a player with the spotlight describes what their character does and the spotlight simply swings to whoever: a. the fiction would naturally turn it toward b. hasnt had the focus in a while, or c. a triggered mechanic puts it on optional: spotlight tracker tool if your group prefers a more traditional action economy, you can use tokens to track how many times a player has had the spotlight: at the start of a session or scene, each player adds a certain number of tokens (we recommend 3) to their character sheet and removes a token each time they take an action. if the spotlight would swing to someone without any tokens, it swings to someone else instead. once every player has used all their available tokens, players refill their character sheet with the same number of tokens as before, then continue playing. making moves & taking action any time a character does something to advance the story, such as speaking with another character, interacting with the environment, making an attack, casting a spell, or using a class feature, they are making a move. action rolls any move where success would be trivial or failure would be boring automatically succeeds, but any move thats difficult to accomplish or risky to attempt triggers an action roll. overview all action rolls require a pair of d12s called duality dice. these are two visually distinct twelve-sided dice, with one die representing hope and the other representing fear. t o make an action roll, you roll the duality dice, sum the results, apply any relevant modifiers, and compare the total to a difficulty number to determine the outcome: success with hope: if your total meets or beats the difficulty and your hope die shows a higher result than your fear die, you rolled a success with hope. you succeed and gain a hope. success with fear: if your total meets or beats the difficulty and your fear die shows a higher result than your hope die, you rolled a success with fear. you succeed with a cost or complication, but the gm gains a fear. failure with hope: if your total is less than the difficulty and your hope die shows a higher result than your fear die, you rolled a failure with hope. you fail with a minor consequence and gain a hope, then the spotlight swings to the gm. failure with fear: if your total is less than the difficulty and your fear die shows a higher result than your hope die, you rolled a failure with fear. you fail with a major consequence and the gm gains a fear, then the spotlight swings to the gm. critical success: if the duality dice show matching results, you rolled a critical success (crit). you automatically succeed with a bonus, gain a hope, and clear a stress. if this was an attack roll, you deal critical damage. note: a critical success counts as a roll with hope. after resolving the action roll, the table works together to weave the outcome into the narrative and play continues. failing forward in daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene changes in some way. there is no such thing as a roll where nothing happens, because the fiction constantly evolves based on the successes and failures of the characters. procedure the following steps describe in more detail the procedure that all action rolls utilize: step 1: pick an appropriate trait some actions and effects specify in their description which trait applies to the roll; otherwise, the gm tells the acting player which character trait best applies to the action being attempted. if more than one trait could apply to the roll, the gm chooses or lets the acting player decide. step 2: determine the difficulty some actions and features say in their description what the difficulty is. otherwise, the gm determines the difficulty based on the scenario. the gm can choose whether to share the difficulty with the table. in either case, the gm should communicate the potential consequences of failure to the acting player. step 3: apply extra dice and modifiers the acting player decides whether to utilize an experience or activate other effects, then, if applicable, adds the appropriate tokens and dice (such as advantage or rally dice) to their dice pool. note: unless an action, ability, or feature specifically allows for it, a player must declare the use of any experiences, extra dice, or other modifiers before they roll. 36 daggerheart srd step 4: roll the dice the acting player rolls their entire dice pool and announces the results in the format of [total result] with [hope/fear] or critical success! in the case of matching duality dice. example: a player is making an action roll with a +1 in the relevant trait and no other modifiers; they roll the duality dice and get a result of 5 on their hope die and 7 on their fear die, then announce i rolled a 13 with fear! step 5: resolve the outcome the active player and the gm work together, along with the suggestions and support of the rest of the table, to resolve the outcome of the action. gm moves and adversary actions gms also make moves. they should consider making a move when a player does one of the following things: rolls with fear on an action roll. fails an action roll. does something that would have consequences. gives them a golden opportunity. looks to them for what happens next. after the gm turn is done, the spotlight goes back to the pcs. many adversaries and environments have fear features, especially powerful or consequential moves that the gm must spend fear to activate. note: this fear is in addition to any fear the gm has previously spent to seize the spotlight or activate another action or ability. adversary actions when play passes to the gm, the gm can make a gm move to spotlight an adversary. a spotlighted adversary can: move within close range and make a standard attack move within close range and use an adversary action clear a condition sprint within far or very far range on the battlefield do anything else the fiction demands or the gm deems appropriate the gm can spend additional fear to spotlight additional adversaries. once the gm has finished, the spotlight swings back to the pcs. special rolls some rolls have unique specifications or otherwise modify the action roll procedure: trait rolls, spellcast rolls, attack rolls, and damage rolls. unless otherwise noted, you can apply any bonus, modifier, or effect to a special roll as if it were a standard action roll.trait rolls an action roll that specifies which character trait applies to it is called a trait roll. in the text of a feature or effect, a trait roll is referenced with the format [trait] roll (difficulty) (e.g., agility roll (12)). if the text of an effect doesnt specify a trait rolls difficulty, the gm sets the difficulty based on the circumstances. features and effects that affect a trait roll also affect any action roll that uses the same trait, including attack rolls, spellcast rolls, and standard action rolls. example: the kataris ancestry feature feline instincts, which allows the katari to reroll an agility roll, can also be used on a standard action roll using agility to traverse dangerous terrain or on an attack roll made with a weapon that uses agility. spellcast rolls spellcast rolls are trait rolls that require you to use your spellcast trait. your spellcast trait, if you have one, is determined by your subclass. spellcast rolls are only made when a character uses a feature that requires one. a successful spellcast roll activates the effect as described by the feature. notes: a spellcast roll that can damage a target is also considered an attack roll. when you cast a spell, the text tells you when the effect ends. the gm can spend a fear to end a temporary effect. if your spell doesnt specify when it ends, it ends when you choose or at a natural moment of the story. you can choose to end your spell early. you can cast and maintain the effects of more than one spell at the same time. reaction rolls a reaction roll is made in response to an attack or a hazard, representing a characters attempt to avoid or withstand an imminent effect. reaction rolls work like action rolls, except they dont generate hope or fear, dont trigger additional gm moves, and other characters cant aid you with help an ally. if you critically succeed on a reaction roll, you dont clear a stress or gain a hope, but you do ignore any effects that would have impacted you on a success, such as taking damage or marking stress. 37 daggerheart srd group action rolls when multiple pcs take action together, the party chooses one pc to lead the action. each other player then describes how their character collaborates on the task. the leader makes an action roll as usual, while the other players make reaction rolls using whichever traits they and the gm decide fit best. the lead character gains a +1 bonus to their lead action roll for each of these reaction rolls that succeeded and a 1 penalty for each these reaction rolls that failed. tag team rolls each player can, once per session, initiate a tag team roll between their character and another pc by spending 3 hope. the players work with one another to describe how they combine their actions in a unique and exciting way. both players make separate action rolls; before resolving the rolls outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply to both actions. on a roll with hope, all pcs involved gain a hope. on a roll with fear, the gm gains a fear token for each pc involved. on a successful tag t eam attack roll, both players roll damage and add the totals together to determine the damage dealt, which is then treated as if it came from a single source. if the attacks deal different types of damage, the players choose which type to deal. notes: a tag team roll counts as a single action roll for the purposes of any countdowns or features that track action rolls. though each player may only initiate one tag team roll per session, one pc can be involved in multiple tag team rolls. advantage & disadvantage some features and effects let you roll with advantage or disadvantage on an action or reaction roll: advantage represents an opportunity that you seize to increase your chances of success. when you roll with advantage, you roll a d6 advantage die with your dice pool and add its result to your total. disadvantage represents an additional difficulty, hardship, or challenge you face when attempting an action. when you roll with disadvantage, you roll a d6 disadvantage die with your dice pool and subtract its result from your total. advantage or disadvantage can be granted or imposed by mechanical triggers or at the gms discretion. when a pc aids you with help an ally, they roll their own advantage die and you add it to your total. advantage and disadvantage dice cancel each out, one-for- one, when they would be added to the same dice pool, so youll never roll both at the same time. if you have advantage or disadvantage from other sources that dont affect your own dice pool, such as another players help an ally move, their effects stack with your rolled results.hope & fear hope and fear are metacurrencies representing the cosmic forces that shape the events of your tables story. hope powers pc abilities and features, while fear powers the abilities of the gm and the adversaries and environments they control. hope every pc starts with 2 hope at character creation and gains more throughout play. a pc can have a maximum of 6 hope at one time, and hope carries over between sessions. players can spend hope to: help an ally when you help an ally who is making an action roll, describe how you do so and roll an advantage die. multiple players can spend hope to help the same acting player, but that player only adds the highest result to their final total. utilize an experience when you utilize an experience on a relevant roll, add its modifier to the result. you can spend multiple hope to utilize multiple experiences. initiate a tag team roll spend 3 hope to initiate a tag t eam roll, combining the actions of two pcs into one impressive act of synergy. when you make a tag t eam roll, both players roll their action rolls and then choose which set of results to apply to the outcome. activate a hope feature a hope feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you to spend a specified amount of hope to activate it. class hope features are class-specific features, detailed on your character sheet, that cost 3 hope to activate. note: when using a hope feature, if you rolled with hope for that action, the hope you gain from that roll can be spent on that feature (or toward it, if it requires spending multiple hope). fear the gm gains fear whenever a player rolls with fear and can spend fear at any time to make or enhance a gm move or to use a fear feature. the gm can have up to 12 fear at one time. fear carries over between sessions. 38 daggerheart srd"

    "text": "though daggerheart relies on the same flow of collaborative storytelling in and out of combat, physical conflicts rely more heavily on several key mechanics related to attacking, maneuvering, and taking damage. evasion evasion represents a characters ability to avoid attacks and other unwanted effects. any roll made against a pc has a difficulty equal to the targets evasion. a pcs base evasion is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects. note: attacks rolled against adversaries use the targets difficulty instead of evasion. hit points & damage thresholds hit points (hp) represent a characters ability to withstand physical injury. when a character takes damage, they mark 1 to 3 hp, based on their damage thresholds: if the final damage is at or above the characters severe damage threshold, they mark 3 hp. if the final damage is at or above the characters major damage threshold but below their severe damage threshold, they mark 2 hp. if the final damage is below the characters major damage threshold, they mark 1 hp. if incoming damage is ever reduced to 0 or less, no hp is marked. a pcs damage thresholds are calculated by adding their level to the listed damage thresholds of their equipped armor. a pcs starting hp is based on their class, but they can gain additional hit points through advancements, features, and other effects. an adversarys damage thresholds and hp are listed in their stat blocks. when a character marks their last hit point, they fall. if a pc falls, they make a death move. characters can clear hit points by taking downtime moves (see: downtime) or by activating relevant special abilities or effects. optional rule: massive damage if a character ever takes damage equal to twice their severe threshold, they mark 4 hp instead of 3.stress stress represents how much mental, physical, and emotional strain a character can endure. some special abilities or effects require the character activating them to mark stress, and the gm can require a pc to mark stress as a gm move or to represent the cost, complication, or consequence of an action roll. when a character marks their last stress, they become vulnerable (see: conditions) until they clear at least 1 stress. when a character must mark 1 or more stress but cant, they mark 1 hp instead. a character cant use a move that requires them to mark stress if all of their stress is marked. pcs can clear stress by making downtime moves (see: downtime). a pcs maximum stress is determined by their class, but they can increase it through advancements, abilities, and other effects."

    "text": "attack rolls an attack roll is an action roll intended to inflict harm. the trait that applies to an attack roll is specified by the weapon or spell being used. unarmed attack rolls use either strength or finesse (gms choice). an attack rolls difficulty, unless otherwise noted, is equal to the difficulty score of its target. damage rolls on a successful attack, roll damage. damage is calculated from the damage roll listed in the attacks description with the format xdy+[modifier] (e.g., for a spell that inflicts 1d8+2 damage, you roll an eight-sided and add 2 to the result; the damage dealt is equal to the total). any time an effect says to deal damage using your spellcast trait, you roll a number of dice equal to your spellcast trait. note: if your spellcast trait is +0 or lower, you dont roll anything. for weapons, the number of damage dice you roll is equal to your proficiency. note that your proficiency multiplies the number of dice you roll, but doesnt affect the modifier. for example, a pc with proficiency 2 and wielding a weapon with a damage rating of d8+2 deals damage equal to 2d8+2 on a successful attack. successful unarmed attacks inflict [proficiency]d4 damage. critical damage when you get a critical success (i.e., you roll matching values on your duality dice) on an attack roll, you deal extra damage. make the damage roll as usual, but add the maximum possible result of the damage dice to the final total. for instance, if an attack would normally deal 2d8+1 damage, a critical success would deal 2d8+1+16. 39 daggerheart srd damage types there are two damage types: physical damage (phy) and magic damage (mag). unless stated otherwise, mundane weapons and unarmed attacks deal physical damage, and spells deal magic damage. resistance, immunity, and direct damage if a target has resistance to a damage type, then they reduce incoming damage of that type by half before comparing it to their hit point thresholds. if the target has additional ways of reducing incoming damage, such as marking armor slots, they apply the resistance effect first. the effects of multiple resistances to the same damage type do not stack. if a target has immunity to a damage type, they ignore incoming damage of that type. if an attack deals both physical and magic damage, a character can only benefit from resistance or immunity if they are resistant or immune to both damage types. direct damage is damage that cant be reduced by marking armor slots. multi-target attack rolls if a spell or ability allows you to target multiple adversaries, make one attack roll and one damage roll, then apply the results to each target individually. multiple damage sources damage dealt simultaneously from multiple sources is always totaled before its compared to its targets damage thresholds. for example, if a pc with orc ancestry makes a successful attack against a target in melee range and decides to spend a hope to use their tusks feature (which gives them an extra 1d6 damage on a damage roll), they would roll their normal weapon damage and add a d6 to the result, then deal that total damage to the adversary. maps, range, and movement you can play daggerheart using theater of the mind or maps and miniatures. the conversions below from abstract ranges to physical measurements assume 1 inch of map represents about 5 feet of fictional space. daggerheart uses the following ranges to translate fictional positioning into relative distance for the purposes of targeting, movement, and other game mechanics: melee: close enough to touch, up to a few feet away. very close: close enough to see fine details, about 510 feet away. while in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from very close range into melee range. on a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card (2-3 inches).close: close enough to see prominent details, about 1030 feet away. while in danger, a character can move, as part of their action, from close range into melee range. on a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5-6 inches). far: close enough to see very little detail, about 30100 feet away. while in danger, a character must make an agility roll to safely move from far range into melee range. on a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a piece of copy paper (1112 inches). very far: t oo far to make out any details, about 100300 feet away. while in danger, a character must make an agility roll to safely move from very far range into melee range. on a map: anything beyond far range, but still within the bounds of the conflict or scene. out of range: anything beyond a characters very far range is out of range and usually cant be targeted. range is measured from the source of an effect, such as the attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect. a weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effects stated range is a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at closer distances. optional rule: defined ranges if your table would rather operate with more precise range rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat. if you do, use the following guidelines for play: melee: 1 square very close: 3 squares close: 6 squares far: 12 squares very far: 13+ squares out of range: off the battlemap movement under pressure when youre under pressure or in danger and make an action roll, you can move to a location within close range as part of that action. if youre not already making an action roll, or if you want to move farther than your close range, you need to succeed on an agility roll to safely reposition yourself. an adversary can move within close range for free as part of an action, or within very far range as a separate action. area of effect unless stated otherwise, all the targets of a group effect must be within very close range of a single origin point within your effects range. line of sight & cover unless stated otherwise, a ranged attacker must have line of sight to their intended target to make an attack roll. if a partial obstruction lies between the attacker and target, the target has cover. attacks made through cover are rolled with disadvantage. if the obstruction is total, there is no line of sight. 40 daggerheart srd"

    "text": "rolling dice the gm has no duality dice; instead, they roll a single d20 called the gms die. adversary attack rolls when an adversary attacks a pc, roll your d20 and add the adversarys attack bonus to the result. if the total meets or beats the targets evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, the attack fails. on a successful attack, roll the attacks damage dice to determine how much it deals. if you roll a natural 20 on an attack, your roll automatically succeeds and you deal extra damage. roll damage normally, then add the highest number on the damage dice to the total. for example, an attack that deals 3d6+2 deals 18+3d6+2 on a critical success; the critical success does not affect the flat damage modifier. note: a critical success on an adversarys reaction roll automatically succeeds, but confers no additional benefit.guidance on action rolls after a player describes a move they want to make during the game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to determine how the scene progresses. use this guide to determine what to present the player, choosing whichever option best fits the situation: determine whether the roll is necessary, considering the pcs experiences or backstory, the pressure theyre acting under, and the possible outcomes. establish the stakes of an action roll before the player makes it. communicate any unavoidable consequences. if desired, you can offer the player the opportunity to forgo an action roll in exchange for agreeing to an interesting outcome, cost, or complication. making moves as the gm, you have gm moves that change the story in response to the players actions. gm moves arent bound by specific spells or effectswhen you make a gm move, you can describe the action in whatever way the fiction demands. gm moves happen during gm turns. a gm turn begins when the spotlight passes to them and ends when the spotlight passes back to the players. when to make a move the gm can make a gm move whenever you want, but the frequency and severity depends on the type of story youre telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the session youre running. make a gm move when the players: roll with fear fail an action roll do something that has unavoidable consequences give you a golden opportunity (an opening that demands an immediate response) look to you for what happens next choosing gm moves the result of a players action roll determines your response: on a critical success, you let the player describe their success, then give them an additional opportunity or advantage. on a success with hope, you let the player describe their success, then you show how the world reacts to it. on a success with fear, you work with the player to describe their success, then take a fear and make a gm move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost: an adversary attacks the pc marks a stress you introduce a new threat you raise the stakes of the conflict 64 daggerheart srd on a failure with hope, you describe how the pc fails to get what they want, then make a gm move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or cost: an adversary attacks the pc marks a stress you introduce a new threat you raise the stakes of the conflict on a failure with fear, you describe how things go wrong, then make a gm move to introduce a major consequence, complication, or cost: you put them in immediate danger they become the focus of multiple adversaries they are separated from their party they lose an important opportunity for good. quick reference: resolving action rolls if youre unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick phrases: success with hope: yes, and (you get what you want and gain a hope.) success with fear: yes, but (you get what you want, but theres a consequence, and the gm gains a fear.) failure with hope: no, but (things dont go as planned, but you gain a hope.) failure with fear: no, and (things dont go as planned and it gets worse. the gm gains a fear.) if the move you should make is not obvious from the fiction, draw inspiration from the example gm moves list: introduce a new obstacle or enemy ask the player what happens have the pc mark a stress t ell the players everything is fine for now. soft and hard moves soft moves go easier on the playersthey give the party new information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to react to it. hard moves are harsher, more impactful, or more directthe pcs dont get an opening to interrupt, alter, or anticipate the outcome. use softer moves on rolls with hope and harder moves on rolls with fear.example gm moves show how the world reacts ask a question and build on the answer make an npc act in accordance with their motive drive a pc to take action by dangling their goals in front of them signal an imminent off-screen threat reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger force the group to split up make a pc mark stress make a move the characters dont see show the collateral damage clear an adversarys condition shift the environment spotlight an adversary capture someone or something important use a pcs backstory against them take away an opportunity permanently. using fear you start a campaign with 1 fear per pc in the party. you gain fear whenever a pc rolls with fear, the pcs take a rest (see: downtime), or when an ability or effect tells you to. you can never have more than 12 fear at one time. fear carries over between sessions. spend a fear to: interrupt the players to steal the spotlight and make a move make an additional gm move use an adversarys fear feature use an environments fear feature add an adversarys experience to a roll 65 daggerheart srd the dramatic tension of a scene correlates with the amount of fear you spend during it. for guidance on how much fear you should spend in a scene, consult the following table: incidental a catch-up between pcs after an emotionally charged scene; gathering information; resupplying at a local market; resting during downtime.01 fear minor a travel sequence; a minor skirmish that introduces new foes or signals future trouble.13 fear standard a substantial battle with a notable objective; perilous travel that tests might and wit; a tense social encounter seeking crucial information or aid.24 fear major a large battle with a solo or leader adversary; a character-defining scene with a significant change to a characters personal story (such as revelation, growth, and betrayal).48 fear climactic a major confrontation with the villain of a story arc; an epic set piece battle; a judicial duel to determine an important npcs fate.612 fearif you find yourself with a large amount of fear, consider: spending fast: spend fear before the players have a chance to react spending often: spend fear every time the spotlight swings to you spending big: spend fear to make multiple moves in a row spending fear to make a move communicates the increased impact of your action. fear moves often include one or more of these elements: introducing new adversaries to a scene when their appearance hasnt been foreshadowed or lacks context. an adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation to deal massive damage or boost their capabilities. an environment exerting a strong negative effect on the party. difficulty benchmarks the difficulty of an attack roll against an adversary is equal to the adversarys difficulty score. the difficulty of any other action rolls against an adversary is equal to the adversarys difficulty score, plus (if applicable) the value of one of the adversary relevant experience modifiers. when a player makes an action roll without a specified difficulty, the gm sets the difficulty according to the totality of the circumstances. refer to the following benchmark table for more guidance: agility roll sprint leap maneuver 5 sprint within close range across an open field with an enemy present.make a running jump of half your height (about 3 feet for a human).walk slowly across a narrow beam. 10 sprint within far range across an open field with an enemy present.make a running jump of your height (about 6

grant them advantage die (or impose disadvantage die) instead of adjusting the difficulty of an action roll. adversary action rolls by default, adversaries dont normally make action rolls except for attack rolls and any unique actions described in their stat blocks. any other action an adversary attempts simply succeeds without an action roll; if you want an adversarys action to have a chance of failure, have any relevant pcs make reaction rolls instead. however, for especially dramatic or difficult tasks that the pcs cant influence, you can give an adversary an action roll anyway. for an adversarys action roll, roll a d20. if the result is equal to or greater than the actions difficulty, the action succeedsotherwise it fails. you can spend a fear before rolling to add a relevant experience from the adversarys stat block to the total. use the same procedure when an adversary makes a reaction roll.adversary advantage & disadvantage if an adversary has advantage on an action roll, the gm rolls an extra d20 and counts only the higher result. if an adversary has disadvantage on an action roll, the gm rolls an extra d20 and counts only the lower result. adversary attacks when an adversary attacks a pc, the gm rolls a d20 and adds the adversarys attack modifier to the result. if the total meets or beats the targets evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, it fails. before rolling, the gm can grant the attacking adversary advantage, impose disadvantage, or spend a fear to add a relevant experience from the adversarys stat block to the total. on a success, the adversary deals the damage listed in their stat block to the target. when an adversarys action lets the gm make an attack against multiple targets, they make one attack roll and compare it to each targets evasion separately. 68 daggerheart srd countdowns countdowns represent a period of time or series of events preceding a future effect. a countdown begins at a starting value. when a countdown advances, its reduced by 1. the countdowns effect is triggered when the countdown reaches 0. note: you can track countdowns by spinning down dice or ticking off boxes. standard countdowns advance every time a player makes an action roll. if an adversary or environment ability refers to a countdown [n], then it means a standard countdown with a starting value of n. dynamic countdowns advance by up to 3 depending on the outcomes of action rolls. consequence countdowns are dynamic countdowns to negative effects. progress countdowns are dynamic countdowns to positive effects. dynamic countdowns advance according to this chart: dynamic countdown advancement roll result progress advancementconsequence advancement failure with fear no advancement tick down 3 failure with hope no advancement tick down 2 success with fear tick down 1 tick down 1 success with hopetick down 2 no advancement critical success tick down 3 no advancement advanced countdown features countdowns with randomized starting values loop countdowns that reset to their starting value after their countdown effect is triggered. increasing countdowns that increase their starting value by 1 every time they loop. decreasing countdowns that decrease their starting value by 1 every time they loop. linked progress and consequence countdowns that simultaneously advance according to the same action roll outcomes. long-term countdowns that advance after rests instead of action rolls. giving out gold, equipment, and loot its up to you and your players how much importance you want to place on gold, equipment, and loot in your campaign. adjust the availability and utility of wealth and equipment to reflect the tone, themes, and setting of your campaign. if you dont wish to track gold, then when pcs go shopping for new items let them pick one or two from a short, preselected list that aligns with your campaign setting and the partys current location. otherwise, set the prices of goods and services by adjusting the entries in the average costs table to reflect your campaign setting: meals for a party of adventurers per night1 handful standard inn room per night 1 handful luxury inn room per night 1 bag carriage ride 2 handfuls mount (horse, mule, etc.) 3 bags specialized tools 3 handfuls fine clothing 3 handfuls luxury clothing 1 bag tier 1 equipment (weapons, armor) 15 handfuls tier 2 equipment (weapons, armor) 12 bags tier 3 equipment (weapons, armor) 510 bags tier 4 equipment (weapons, armor) 12 chests running gm npcs when you run npcs as the gm, you should always strive to follow your gm principles and use them to bring the world to life. differentiate npcs with unique manners of speech and action; let their individual goals and desires motivate their actions. the only essential elements for a npc are their name, description, and motive. if its likely that the pcs will roll actions against them, give them a difficulty. adversaries can be invented or improvised by modifying the stat block of another adversary. if an npc becomes an ally in combat, they dont need a stat blockjust put the spotlight on what they do and show how their involvement alters the fiction. if a pc capitalizes on their help during the scene, give the pc advantage. npcs that dont have hit points or stress can still be injured or killed if the fiction demands it. if you want an important npc to mechanically interact with the system, you can give them one or more features with specific triggers and effects. an npc might also have a choice that adjusts the parameters of their feature. for example: arcane hold choice: when the battle begins, choose a favored pc. trigger: the first time during a battle the favored pc is within close range and hit with an attack. effect: make an attack roll with a +6 modifier against the adversary. on a success, the target is temporarily restrained by tendrils of powerful magic. 69 daggerheart srd npc feature examples volley of arrows trigger: a battle begins and this npc is involved. effect: activate a countdown (loop 3). it ticks down when a pc misses an attack. when it triggers, this npc releases a volley of arrows at a target of the pcs choice, dealing 2d8+3 physical damage. mentor choice: when the battle begins, choose a protg pc. trigger: your protg is within close range and fails an attack roll. effect: move into melee range with the pc and give them advice or guidance. the next attack roll they make has advantage. regroup choice: when a battle begins, choose a point within far range. trigger: all pcs have marked all of their armor slots. effect: t eleport all pcs and this npc to the chosen spot and clear an armor slot on each target. into the night trigger: the pcs start a long rest with this npc. effect: roll 1d4. on a 2 or less, this npc steals 1 handful of gold from the party while they are sleeping, then disappears into the night. optional gm mechanics fate rolls when the gm wants to leave an outcome entirely up to chance, they call for a fate roll. the gm establishes whats at stake and how the roll will be interpreted. then a player rolls one of their duality dice and interprets the result. examples: roll your fear die. on a 4 or lower, the fire spreads beyond this house. i think its really up to chance whether reinforcements will make it to you in time. go ahead and roll your fear die thatll determine the starting size of the countdown. when that triggers, reinforcements will arrive in your far range. go ahead and roll your hope die to see how big the crowd at the inn is tonight. the higher the roll, the bigger the crowd. make a roll using your hope die to determine the number of stamina potions the shop has in stock.falling and collision damage if a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as a guide to determine the damage they take: a fall from very close range deals 1d10+3 physical damage. a fall from close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage. a fall from far or very far range deals 1d100+15 physical damage, or death at the gms discretion. if a character collides with an object or another character at a dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage. moving and fighting underwater by default, attack rolls made while the attacker is underwater have disadvantage. for creatures that cant breathe underwater, use a standard countdown (3) to track how long they can hold their breath. advance the countdown whenever the pc takes an action. in addition if they fail a roll or roll with fear while underwater, you can spend your gm move to advance it an additional timeor twice, if they rolled a failure with fear. once the countdown ends, the underwater pc must mark a stress whenever they take an action. conflict between pcs sometimes a player might want their character to act against another pc in the scene. before jumping to rolling dice, discuss the situation with both players to decide how to resolve the conflict. a roll might not be necessary to reach an outcomebut if rolling will be fun for everyone involved, come to a consensus on the terms of the roll, then facilitate the scene according to the results. on an attack roll against a pc, the attacker rolls against the defenders evasion, just like an adversary. on any other kind of action roll, the instigator makes an action roll and the target makes a reaction roll. t o succeed, the instigator must beat a difficulty equal to the total value of the reaction roll. 70 daggerheart srd adversaries and environments using adversaries adversary stat blocks all the information required to run an adversary is contained in their stat block. an adversarys stat block includes their: name each stat block has a unique name. abilities that affect adversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who use that stat block, regardless of their in-story name. tier each adversary is designed to oppose pcs of a certain tier. if you confront the party with an adversary from another tier, adjust their stats. type the adversarys type appears alongside their tier. an adversarys type represents the role they play in a conflict. the adversary types are: bruisers: tough; deliver powerful attacks. hordes: groups of identical creatures acting together as a single unit. leaders: command and summon other adversaries. minions: easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers. ranged: fragile in close encounters but deal high damage at range. skulks: maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush opponents. socials: present challenges around conversation instead of combat. solos: present a formidable challenge to a whole party, with or without support. standards: representative of their fictional group. supports: enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents. description a summary of the adversary's appearance and demeanor. motives & tactics suggusted impulses, actions and goals for the adversary. difficulty the difficulty of any roll made against the adversary, unless otherwise noted. damage thresholds, hit points, and stress these systems function the same way they do for pcs. the numbers listed after threshold are the adversarys major and severe thresholds. attack modifier when you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or penalty to your attack roll. standard attack a description of the adversarys primary mode of inflicting harm on the pcs. it includes the attacks name, its effective range, and the damage it deals on a success. using an adversarys standard attack is a gm move. experience (optional) the gm can spend a fear to add an adversarys relevant experience to raise their attack roll or increase the difficulty of a roll made against them. example experiences: acrobatics hunt from above navigation ambusher intimidation nobility bartering intrusion quick reflexes blademaster keen senses socialite bodyguard magical knowledgestealth commander natures friend tracker feature(s) there are three kinds of adversary features: actions, reactions, and passives. note: each adversaries stress is tracked individually. if a feature requires the gm to spend stress to activate it, the stress must come from the adversary whose feature is being activate. if a feature has a fear requirement, it must be spent in addition to any fear already spentfor instance, to interrupt the pcs and put the spotlight on the adversary. actions: a special attack or other unique action that the adversary can perform when the spotlight is on them. reactions: special effects that take effect when their trigger occurs, regardless of whether the spotlight is on the adversary. passives: special abilities that remain in effect by default and require no resources or triggers to activate. fear feature(s) high-impact effects that cost a fear to activate. 71 daggerheart srd example adversary features: actions haymaker - action: make an attack against a target within very close range. on a success, deal x direct physical damage. shredding strike - action: make an attack against a target within very close range. on a success, deal x physical damage and the target must mark an armor slot without gaining its benefit (they can still use armor to reduce the damage). more where that came from - action: summon three jagged knife lackeys, who appear at far range. reactions heavy hitter - reaction: when this adversary deals damage with a standard attack, you can spend a fear to gain a +x bonus to the damage roll. team-up - reaction: when another adversary within very close range of this adversary deals x damage to a creature, you can mark a stress to make a standard attack against that same creature. on a success, combine the damage. momentum - reaction: when this adversary makes a successful attack against a pc, you gain a fear. passives horde (x) - passive: when the horde has marked half or more of their hp, their standard attack deals x damage instead. minion (x) - passive: this adversary is defeated when they take any damage. for every x damage a pc deals to this adversary, defeat an additional minion within range the attack would succeed against. relentless (x) - passive: this adversary can be spotlighted up to x times per gm turn. spend fear as usual to spotlight them. slow - passive: when you spotlight this adversary and they dont have a token on their stat block, they cant act yet. place a token on their stat block and describe what theyre preparing to do. when you spotlight this adversary and they have a token on their stat block, clear the token and they can act. arcane form - passive: this adversary is resistant to magic damage. armored carapace - passive: when this adversary takes physical damage, reduce it by x. fear features explosion - action: spend a fear to erupt in a fiery explosion. make an attack against all targets within close range. targets the adversary succeeds against take 1d8 magic damage and are knocked back to far range.building balanced encounters when planning a battle, start with [(3 x the number of pcs in combat) + 2] battle points and make the following adjustments: -1 for an easier or shorter fight -2 if youre using 2 or more solo adversaries -2 if you add +1d4 (or a static +2) to all adversaries damage rolls +1 if you choose an adversary from a lower tier +1 if you dont include any bruisers, hordes, leaders, or solos +2 for a harder or longer fight then spend your battle points to add an adversary to the encounter: spend 1 point for each group of minions equal to the size of the party. spend 1 point for each social or support adversary. spend 2 points for each horde, ranged, skulk, or standard adversary. spend 3 points for each leader adversary. spend 4 points for each bruiser adversary. spend 5 points for each solo adversary. defeated adversaries when an adversary marks their last hit point, they are defeated: incapacitated, tied up, routed, killed, or anything else the table decides makes sense. 72 daggerheart srd using environments environments represent everything in a scene beyond the pcs and adversaries, such as the physical space, background npcs, and natural forces. environment stat block each environments stat block presents their necessary mechanical statistics: name the unique name of the environment stat block. tier the pc tier the environment is designed to challenge. type the type of scene it most easily supports: explorations wondrous locations with mysteries and marvels to discover socials locations that primarily present interpersonal challenges traversals dangerous locations where movement through and around the space itself is a challenge events special activities or occurrences (rather than physical spaces) description an evocative one-line summary of the environment. impulses the manner or mode with which the environment pushs and pulls the people within them. difficulty the standard difficulty for action rolls made to overcome, oppose, or resist the environment or its elements. potential adversaries suggested adversaries that might appear in scenes within the environment. features features provide inspiration for gm moves you can use that represent the dynamic landscape or situation. feature questions prompts for plot hooks, narrative engines, and connections to other story elements. adapting environments sometimes you want to use an environment but its at the wrong tier for your party. or you might want to replace a feature or two, then present it as an entirely different environment. whether planning your session or even improvising an environment mid-session, you can adjust an existing environments stat block to fit the needs of your scene or improvise elements as needed. the environments framework is there to help organize ideas, not to stifle creativity. when you need to quickly adjust a stat block to a different tier, you can simply replace its existing statistics with those listed on the environment statistics by tier table, using the column that corresponds to your partys tier. benchmark statistics for environments by tier environment statistic tier 1 tier 2 tier 3 tier 4 damage dice 1d6+1 to

of daggerheart. story beats in storytelling, a beat is a moment that changes the trajectory of the narrativea shift in the world, a significant action or reaction, an emotional revelation, or an important decision. take turns with the players, narrating a beat and then letting them react and carry the scene forward with their own beats. when preparing for a session, plan in terms of the moments that give shape to each scene or sequence, rather than pre- scripting specific details or exchanges. preparing combat encounters build the hurdles the pcs face around the question of what helps tell the story? enemies, environments, and hazards are the tools for heightening tension and creating drama. ensure that combat is being used to give players more information about the unfolding story, revealing the world, the plot, or the characters. battles and narrative dynamic battles create suspense by forcing players to choose between their various objectives, engaging their characters motivations and weaknesses, and creating the crucible that the players use to forge their characters into legendary heroes. when preparing combat encounters: consider the narrative function of the battle base adversaries moves on their motives use dynamic environments to bring the battleground to life add enemies that can interact with the pcs features and special abilities session rewards reward players at the end of a session with: useful information story hooks loot gold access to new equipment or enhancements crafting scenes whenever you start a session, arrive at a new place, or change the situation, tell the players what they need to know by thinking with all of your senses and sharing something unique or unexpected about the fiction.engaging your players keep your players engaged by: rotating the focus between the pcs tying t ogether story elements engaging quiet players using visual aids encouraging unguided play confronting the pcs with internal and external conflicts raise the stakes by spending fear layering goals other than attrition into combat (see table of random objectives on the next page) 1d12 objective 1 acquire (obtain or steal) an important item or items. 2 capture one or more of the opponents. 3 activate a magical device. 4 frame a character or tarnish their reputation. 5 drive the opponent into a corner or ambush point. 6 stop a magical ritual, legal ceremony, or time- sensitive spell. 7 hold the linekeep the enemy from reaching a specific area or group. 8 plant evidence or a tracking device on a target. 9 secure a specific location ahead of another groups arrival. 10 harass the opponent to deplete their resources or keep them occupied. 11 destroy a piece of architecture, a statue, a shrine, or a weapon. 12 investigate a situation to confirm or deny existing information. phased battles make battles by shifting the nature of its enemies or environment mid-combat: change the t erms of engagement alter the environment evolve the opposition using downtime use downtime scenes as a pressure release valve to vary the intensity of the story and give the pcs room to breathe. empower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved 112 daggerheart srd projects during downtime the work on a project downtime move requires more gm input than other downtime moves and is best suited for long- term endeavors the pcs wish to undertake. these projects are typically tracked using a progress countdown. when deciding the starting value of the countdown, consider the complexity of the project, the availability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project on the story. simple projects advance their countdown each time a player uses the work on a project move, but complex projects require a roll. extended downtime when you fast-forward the story across an extended period, use montages to illustrate the passage of time. you gain 1d6 fear per pc and advance any long-term countdowns as appropriate. campaign frames a campaign frame provides inspiration, tools, and mechanics to support a particular type of story at the table. every campaign frame has a complexity rating that indicates how much its mechanics deviate

cisco, rowan hall, & spenser starke complexity rating: the pitch read this section to your players to introduce them to the campaign. fanewick was once a place of great abundance and peacedangerous to those unfamiliar with the land, but a cornucopia to those who respected its ways. when haven invaded the wilds and forced the land into eternal spring, a dangerous bloom known as the witherwild took hold and now threatens the lives of all who live there. in a witherwild campaign, youll play unlikely heroes from humble beginnings who are reckoning with their newfound duty to save fanewicks people from dangerous corruption. tone & feel adventurous, dynamic, epic, heroic, thrilling, uncanny, whimsical themes cultural clash, ends justify means, grief, people vs. nature, transformation and change, survival touchstones princess mononoke, the legend of zelda, the dark crystal, nausica of the valley of the wind overview if your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation. fanewick is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside forces. the woods are dark and twisting, filled with faint divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. this wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. these wicklings remained insulated from their neighbors wars until plague forced the people of haven to desperate acts. haven was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase the godless gate. while the original meaning has been 113 daggerheart srd lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of haven wished to be free of the influence of the faint divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. they hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as shunaush the granite ophid. while their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured havens dominance in the region for centuries to come. they made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that haven is known for. but shunaush would have his revenge. as the havenites carved through his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. there was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. but progress is its own pressure. the growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. the same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague. over the last two years, over half of havens populace fell to a disease known as the serpents sickness. first, victims cough up dust. soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. finally, their body hardensfirst the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. once within the organs, the serpent moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony. the high magus of haven, archmage phylax, discovered a rare red flower called the crimson ladys veil that could cure the serpents sickness. these buds grow prolifically across fanewick in the springbut for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms. desperate to save their people from the plague, haven invaded fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of archmage phylax, plucked out the reaping eye from the most powerful faint divinity that protected the land: the great owl nikta, the shepherd of the seasons. the shepherd kept fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. thus nikta maintained the cycle of seasonsof growth and decay, of death and rebirth. with her reaping eye removed, nikta can only watch over fanewick with the sowing eye, forcing the land into everlasting spring. in the year since, haven has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. the endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the witherwildfanewicks flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. this explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long. prior to the serpents sickness and the shepherds endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in fanewick or a life of toil and conquest in haven. but when the danger demands a response, even the unpreparedand unwillingmust make a stand.communities all communities are available, but some have unique aspects within a witherwild campaign. as needed, provide the following information to your players and choose one or more of the questions to ask them during your session zero. loreborne and highborne in fanewick, knowledge is the most valuable commodity, and those who have expertise have the most power. this economy of information functions primarily through gifting and trading, and wisdom would be considered acceptable collateral for a weapon or warm meal. as such, loreborne community members are the wealthiest in fanewick and might be smaller, distinct groups of hunters, historians, or artisans within larger villages. what knowledge did your community teach you that you must now protect or share? what are you able to accomplish because of your upbringing that others outside your community do not understand? you once traded important knowledge for something terrible. what did you impart and what did you gain in return? in haven, the wealthiest members are highborne, having inherited riches built in the walled city over generations. while the highborne of haven were more insulated from the serpents sickness, none were immune. who have you lost to the serpents sickness? how did it affect you? how did your family make their wealth? have you rejected or embraced their core set of ethics? you grew up in a world of abundance but were kept from learning something about the world. what was this knowledge and when did you discover it? ridgeborne, underborne, and wildborne characters from these communities were likely raised in fanewicks deadly environs, which have only become more dangerous as the witherwild grows. each community has unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret, that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and the faint divinities territories. in exchange for protection from the witherwild for themselves and their families, some wicklings from these groups have been forced to take jobs as farmers in havens flower fields. though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping witherwild. 114 daggerheart srd what faint divinities do you give tribute to, and how have you been rewarded in kind? you displeased a god of fanewick. what did you do, and what misfortune befell you or a loved one? you fled the place of your birth. what circumstances drove you to leave? orderborne players might choose to build orderborne characters if they want to play current or former members of the haven army that invaded fanewick. though the army brings violence into this land, they also carry overwhelming grief for a homeland succumbing to disease. what regrets do you carry with you from your conquest of foreign soil? what kindness did an enemy combatant bestow upon you in an hour of need? how did this change your view of the people of fanewick? you were charged with planting a rumor in a fanewick community. what is the rumor, and do you plan to carry out this mission? slyborne as the haven army is the current martial power in fanewick, those who wish to play slyborne characters might come from fanewick rebel groups seeking to expel the invading forces from their lands. depending on the tactics their group employs, a character from a slyborne community might align with or go against their upbringing. who among the haven army do you wish to exact revenge upon and why? you joined an insurgent group working to free this land from havens grasp. what has given you doubts about the leaderships methods? someone you love is a member of the haven army. how have you used your position in the rebellion to protect them? seaborne both fanewick and haven have a coastal border. the majority of fanewicks seaborne communities live in small seaside groups and focus on local travel to neighboring regions, while havenites tend to live in large ports that ship and receive goods from distant lands.you recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. what went terribly wrong on that passage, and how has it changed you? growing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. what did you learn, and how did it save your life? you used to sail with a companion. who were they, and how do you remain connected? wanderborne wanderborne communities can be found in both fanewick and haven, though safe travel has been severely restricted due to the military occupation and the expansion of the witherwild. whether a wanderborne character comes from fanewick, haven, or elsewhere, the player should determine their characters personal views on the invasion of fanewick, and how that aligns or departs from their communitys views. what do you do to keep your small community safe, independent, and hidden from havens forces? because of your communitys transience, you have loved ones in both fanewick and haven. how has this affected your relationship with the invasion? your community travels to protect something. what is it, and why does it keep you from settling down?"

mind while you gm this campaign. paint the world in contrast subvert expectations by giving space for the nightmarish to charm and the beautiful to terrify. give the pcs visions of the natural beauty of fanewick that has run roughshod across the region, breaking the bounds of the bogs and forests and devastating homes and communities. show the grim and ordered life behind havens walls, but also show the culture, art, and progress that has come out of centuries of safety. contrast the capricious nature of the faint divinities with the devotion of the wicklings and havenites fighting to save their home. in a place of long nights and days, dual seasons, and two nations in conflict, look for ways to highlight bold dualities. show them true danger though it may be tragic, bodily harm is not the worst tragedy that can befall the characters. t o illustrate whats truly at stake, use the pcs origins in fanewick or haven to show them what they stand to lose, be it their homes, family, friends, communities, or even their core truths and beliefs. the events of this campaign may change, threaten, or destroy these aspects of their pastwhen your players create and are invested in their characters backstory, they have something to fight for. offer alternatives to violence by illuminating nonviolent approaches to problem-solving, the pcs can help break the brutal cycle that binds this world. for example, showing compassionrather than swordpoint to a corrupted beast can free them from the witherwild. similarly, the conflict between haven and fanewick shouldnt only be solved with blood and blade. what threatens both could also unify them. give the pcs opportunities to mend old wounds, right past wrongs, and heal the rift between haven and fanewick from within. create multidimensional allies and adversaries no adversary or ally is all good or all bad, and they each have multidimensional lives. even the most congenial ally should be hiding darkness inside them, hoping their failings will go undiscovered. those painted as evil should sometimes do the right thing, even if its for the wrong reason. just because a pc or npc is from haven doesnt make them a villain, and, conversely, not all the inhabitants of fanewick are virtuous. finding the nuance, complications, and deeper motivations of the people of haven and fanewick will lead to richer interactions, more complex moral choices, and a deeper sense of attachment to the world for the players. 116 daggerheart srd distinctions use this information to prepare your campaign. you can also share it with your players as needed. the weeks of day and night the day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises for an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same length. this has an impact on everything from agriculture to trade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night. but this cycle doesnt just affect wicklings, its dictated how fanewicks wondrous ecology has evolved. days and nights are accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes as fanewicks nocturnal denizens sleep through the long days and stalk the woods in times of darkness while their diurnal counterparts sleep. the plants similarly live on this strange day-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a week. sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the tree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the light of the moon. conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent flower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay, only blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of foresta godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark. the serpents sickness the plague sweeping across haven spares no one. since the initial outbreak, haven officials have worked tirelessly to quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this effort has done little to stop its spread. due to the rarity of crimson ladys veil, many citizens began to carry or consume all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to protect or cure themselves. in the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. then a scaled rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique and painful pattern that resembles a snakes skin. not long after, the victims bodies harden until their organs solidify and cease to function. the final stages of the serpents sickness is so quick that many transform into statues where they stand, leaving all of haven a cenotaph to a once-great power. ladys veil these small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout fanewick. for every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled flowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. these flowers have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. even so, they were only foraged until the havenites discovered crimson ladys veilthe only known cure for serpents sickness. thus, the haven army invaded fanewick and began cultivating the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the regions bogs. though the theft of the reaping eye has created an indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare, and fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the haven army races to mass-produce a cure for the serpents sickness. the witherwild this corruption, empowered by the endless spring, is spreading throughout fanewick. some believe the overgrowth began in the forest, while others claim it sprang from the bogs. but no matter its origins, this flourishing malignancy induces horrific changes and massive growth on anything it touches, transforming them into withered beings. plants spring to life with a desire to consume all around them. animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and claws. even harmless creatures that were once hunted for food have become dangerous and formidable adversaries. when a person is corrupted by the witherwild, either from a purposeful attack or accidental harm (see the upcoming corruption from the witherwild section), they are transformed. they become a nightmarish hybridtheir body warped and intertwined with plant or beast. the witherwild slowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same drive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted fanewick. though the withered may retain a semblance of who they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of their personhood. some wicklings believe the withered are gifted this power by niktas wrath to drive the forces of haven from fanewick and return the shepherds reaping eye. the gods of fanewick gods in this land arent ethereal concepts that exist in another realm; instead, they wander the land as incarnate beings, residing in both the natural world as well as within homes and small villages. as such, theyre generally present in wicklings lives. many communities, and some larger families, even have their own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them. belief and worship take on a different meaning in fanewick there is a constant push and pull between the goals of people and their deific neighbors. the gods must curry worship from mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service, or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. mortals rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe when traveling and working in fanewick. the most powerful and widely acknowledged faint divinity is the shepherd of seasons, nikta, as the loss of her eye had the most recent and visible impact on everyone in fanewick. fanewicks various divinities each have their own opinion concerning the witherwild corruption. while some enjoy natures newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are wary of how out of balance fanewick has become. while their behavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are more accessible than gods who watch from on high. fulg, stacker of stones: a small god who favors tribute in the form of smooth, stacked river rocks. under his power, bivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they can be easily harvested. he is largely uninformed about the problems fanewick faces, and he prefers it that way. hyacynis, they who spread small blossoms: a friend of bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the witherwild after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) to immense proportions. theyre enjoying this rampant growth and do not see a reason to end it. 117 daggerheart srd ikla, the sky painter: iklas artistic prowess and talent are unmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and sunset over fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors. they could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their demeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone would ask a favor of them during their time off. oove, the watcher of the night bloom: he is one of the few local gods who has never been seen, but he is often heard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost travelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night bloom. locals claim he leads those who displease him or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. its rumored that he watches over fanewick nights from his home on the moon. quigar, whispered sweetness for a thorny end: a quiet god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in thorny bushes and briar patches. traditionally, she doesnt receive many visitors, but the witherwilds corruptive growth has made her job harder and upended her quiet existence. rohkin, the wandering horn: rohkin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in fanewick. in happier times, he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. but since the corruption of the witherwild has taken hold, hes seen his herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts. these are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands, of faint divinities lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing throughout fanewick. what faint divinities do the pcs acknowledge and pay tribute to, if any? how has the witherwild changed the outlook, personality, and dispositions of the faint divinities the characters encounter? which gods ally themselves with haven to preserve the endless spring? which align with fanewick? the inciting incident you can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own. the reaping eye is stowed in a secure vault beneath the central tower of havens wizarding school, seemingly impossible to recover. a secretive and dangerous rebel group, led by a mysterious figure known only as the fanewraith (she/ her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the witherwild: find the great owl, nikta, and pluck out the sowing eye. while this may solve the immediate problem, the long-term consequences are not being considered, just as they werent when haven invaded. havens beleaguered spymaster, kreil dirn (he/him), is not a popular person in haven. he is responsible for rooting out insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to start, and keeping a close watch on havens internal activities. kreil has never agreedat least not openlywith archmage phylaxs (they/them) decision to steal the reaping eye, and the consequences theyve all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating. recently, kreil uncovered the fanewraiths plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. knowing he cant send a troop of haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the fanewraith from stealing the sowing eye, kreil uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the fanewraith to swift justice. the party is sent an invitation from haven to meet with kreil. but is his information correct? does he have his own motivation or secret ambition? whether they come from fanewick or haven, the party must extend some trust to a person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the enemy they pursue. and what will they do when they find the fanewraith? bring her to justice? side with her? attempt to recover the reaping eye? kreil advises the party to start their hunt for the fanewraith in the treetop village of alula, where he suspects she runs her operation. campaign mechanics the following mechanics are unique to this campaign. corruption from the witherwild adversaries and environments in this campaign can gain an additional type called withered. when an adversary is withered, describe how the witherwild changed or impacted how they would normally appear or operate. you also need about 20 wither tokens (these can be the same as the tokens you use for fear). any time a pc takes severe damage from a withered adversary or environment, gain a wither token and place it on that pcs character sheet. when you do, the pc must roll their fear die. if they roll equal to or below the number of wither tokens on their sheet, they immediately gain a scar and clear all tokens, describing how the witherwild changes them permanently. at the end of each session, clear all wither tokens from the pcs sheets and gain an equal amount of fear. if a character ever dies with wither tokens on their sheet, their body is permanently taken over by the witherwild. session zero questions ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own. what dangerous animal comes out during the week of night that isnt out during the week of day? what unique trait (such as appearance, smell, or taste) does anything tainted by the witherwild have? what superstitions does your character or their community have about traversing fanewick during the long nights? your character has witnessed something beautiful that came from the witherwild. what is it and how has it transformed their view of the corruption? 118
